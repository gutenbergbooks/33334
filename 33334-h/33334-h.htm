<h2>PREFACE</h2>
</div>
<p>The celebration of the Centennial Anniversary of
the United States at the city of Philadelphia in 1876,
and the exhibit there made of that nation&#8217;s wonderful
growth and progress, gave a new and remarkable
impulse to the germs of patriotism in American life.
The following tales of the American Revolution&mdash;with
the exception of the last&mdash;were written twenty-two
years ago, and are the outcome of an interest
then awakened. They all appeared in magazines
and other publications of that period, from which
they have been gathered into this volume, in the
hope that thereby patriotism may grow stronger in
the children of to-day.</p>

<h2>THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.</h2>
</div>
<p>One hundred years and one ago, in
Boston, at ten of the clock one April
night, a church steeple had been
climbed and a lantern hung out.</p>
<p>At ten, the same night, in mid-river of the
Charles, oarsmen two, with passenger silent and
grim, had seen the signal light out-swung, and
rowed with speed for the Charlestown shore.</p>
<p>At eleven, the moon was risen, and the grim
passenger, Paul Revere, had ridden up the Neck,
encountered a foe, who opposed his ride into the
country, and, after a brief delay, had gone on,
leaving a British officer lying in a clay pit.</p>
<p>At midnight, a hundred ears had heard the
flying horseman cry, &#8220;Up and arm. The Regulars
are coming out!&#8221;</p>
<p>You know the story well. You have heard
how the wild alarm ran from voice to voice and
echoed beneath every roof, until the men of Lexington
and Concord were stirred and aroused
with patriotic fear for the safety of the public
stores that had been committed to their keeping.</p>
<p>You know how, long ere the chill April day
began to dawn, they had drawn, by horse power
and by hand power, the cherished stores into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
safe hiding-places in the depth of friendly forest-coverts.</p>
<p>There is one thing about that day that you
have <i>not</i> heard and I will tell you now. It is,
how one little woman staid in the town of Concord,
whence all the women save her had fled.</p>
<p>All the houses that were standing then, are
very old-fashioned now, but there was one dwelling-place
on Concord Common that was old-fashioned
even then! It was the abode of Martha
Moulton and &#8220;Uncle John.&#8221; Just who &#8220;Uncle
John&#8221; was, is not known to the writer, but he
was probably Martha Moulton&#8217;s uncle. The
uncle, it appears by record, was eighty-five years
old; while the niece was <i>only</i> three-score and
eleven.</p>
<p>Once and again that morning, a friendly hand
had pulled the latch-string at Martha Moulton&#8217;s
kitchen entrance and offered to convey herself
and treasures away, but, to either proffer, she had
said: &#8220;No, I must stay until Uncle John gets the
cricks out of his back, if all the British soldiers in
the land march into town.&#8221;</p>
<p>At last, came Joe Devins, a lad of fifteen years&mdash;Joe&#8217;s
two astonished eyes peered for a moment
into Martha Moulton&#8217;s kitchen, and then eyes and
owner dashed into the room, to learn what the
sight he there saw could mean.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whew! Mother Moulton, what are you
doing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m getting Uncle John his breakfast to be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
sure, Joe,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;Have <i>you</i> seen so
many sights this morning that you don&#8217;t know
breakfast, when you see it? Have a care there,
for hot fat <i>will</i> burn,&#8221; as she deftly poured the
contents of a pan, fresh from the fire, into a dish.</p>
<p>Hungry Joe had been astir since the first drum
had beat to arms at two of the clock. He gave
one glance at the boiling cream and the slices of
crisp pork swimming in it, as he gasped forth the
words, &#8220;Getting breakfast in Concord <i>this</i> morning!
<i>Mother Moulton</i>, you <i>must</i> be crazy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So they tell me,&#8221; she said, serenely. &#8220;There
comes Uncle John!&#8221; she added, as the clatter of
a staff on the stone steps of the stairway outrang,
for an instant, the cries of hurrying and confusion
that filled the air of the street.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know, Mother Moulton,&#8221; Joe went
on to say, &#8220;that every single woman and child
have been carried off, where the Britishers won&#8217;t
find &#8217;em?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe the king&#8217;s troops have stirred
out of Boston,&#8221; she replied, going to the door
leading to the stone staircase, to open it for Uncle
John.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t believe it?&#8221; and Joe looked, as he
echoed the words, as though only a boy could
feel sufficient disgust at such a want of common
sense, in full view of the fact, that Reuben Brown
had just brought the news that eight men had
been killed by the king&#8217;s Red Coats in Lexington,
which fact he made haste to impart.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t believe a word of it,&#8221; she said, stoutly,
&#8220;until I see the soldiers coming.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! Hear that!&#8221; cried Joe, tossing back his
hair and swinging his arms triumphantly at an
airy foe. &#8220;You won&#8217;t have to wait long. <i>That
signal</i> is for the minute men. They are going to
march out to meet the Red Coats. Wish I was a
minute man, this minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, poor Uncle John was getting down
the steps of the stairway, with many a grimace
and groan. As he touched the floor, Joe, his face
beaming with excitement and enthusiasm, sprang
to place a chair for him at the table, saying,
&#8220;Good morning,&#8221; at the same moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;May be,&#8221; groaned Uncle John, &#8220;youngsters
<i>like you may</i> think it is a good morning, but <i>I don&#8217;t</i>.
Such a din and clatter as the fools have kept up all
night long. If I had the power&#8221; (and now the
poor old man fairly groaned with rage), &#8220;I&#8217;d make
&#8217;em quiet long enough to let an old man get a wink
of sleep, when the rheumatism lets go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m real sorry for you,&#8221; said Joe, &#8220;but you
don&#8217;t know the news. The king&#8217;s troops, from
camp, in Boston, are marching right down here,
to carry off all our arms that they can find.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are they?&#8221; was the sarcastic rejoinder. &#8220;It&#8217;s
the best news I&#8217;ve heard in a long while. Wish
they had my arms, this minute. They wouldn&#8217;t
carry them a step further than they could help, I
know. Run and tell them that mine are ready,
Joe.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span></div>
<p>&#8220;But, Uncle John, wait until after breakfast,
you&#8217;ll want to use them once more,&#8221; said Martha
Moulton, trying to help him into a chair that Joe
had placed on the white sanded floor.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Joe Devins had ears for all the
sounds that penetrated the kitchen from out of
doors, and he had eyes for the slices of well-browned
pork and the golden-hued Johnny-cake lying
before the glowing coals on the broad hearth.</p>
<p>As the little woman bent to take up the breakfast,
Joe, intent on doing some kindness for her in
the way of saving treasures, asked, &#8220;Sha&#8217;n&#8217;t I help
you, Mother Moulton?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon I am not so old that I can&#8217;t lift a mite
of corn-bread,&#8221; she replied with chilling severity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I didn&#8217;t mean to lift <i>that thing</i>,&#8221; he made
haste to explain, &#8220;but to carry off things and hide
&#8217;em away, as everybody else has been doing half
the night. I know a first-rate place up in the
woods. Used to be a honey tree, you know, and
it&#8217;s just as hollow as anything. Silver spoons and
things would be just as safe in it&mdash;&#8221; but Joe&#8217;s
words were interrupted by unusual tumult on the
street and he ran off to learn the news, intending
to return and get the breakfast that had been
offered to him.</p>
<p>Presently he rushed back to the house with
cheeks aflame and eyes ablaze with excitement.
&#8220;They&#8217;re coming!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;They&#8217;re in sight
down by the rocks. They see &#8217;em marching, the
men on the hill do!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span></div>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean that it&#8217;s really true that the
soldiers are coming here, <i>right into our town</i>!&#8221;
cried Martha Moulton, rising in haste and bringing
together, with rapid flourishes to right and to
left, every fragment of silver on it. Divining her
intent, Uncle John strove to hold fast his individual
spoon, but she twitched it without ceremony
out from his rheumatic old fingers, and ran
next to the parlor cupboard, wherein lay her
movable treasures.</p>
<p>&#8220;What in the world shall I do with them?&#8221; she
cried, returning with her apron well filled, and
borne down by the weight thereof.</p>
<p>&#8220;Give &#8217;em to me,&#8221; cried Joe. &#8220;Here&#8217;s a basket.
Drop &#8217;em in, and I&#8217;ll run like a brush-fire
through the town and across the old bridge, and
hide &#8217;em as safe as a weasel&#8217;s nap.&#8221;</p>
<p>Joe&#8217;s fingers were creamy; his mouth was half
filled with Johnny-cake, and his pocket on the
right bulged to its utmost capacity with the same,
as he held forth the basket; but the little woman
was afraid to trust him, as she had been afraid to
trust her neighbors.</p>
<p>&#8220;No! No!&#8221; she replied, to his repeated offers.
&#8220;I know what I&#8217;ll do. You, Joe Devins, stay
right where you are until I come back, and, don&#8217;t
you even <i>look</i> out of the window.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear, dear me!&#8221; she cried, flushed and
anxious when she was out of sight of Uncle
John and Joe. &#8220;I <i>wish</i> I&#8217;d given &#8217;em to Colonel
Barrett when he was here before daylight,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
only, I <i>was</i> afraid I should never get sight of
them again.&#8221;</p>
<p>She drew off one of her stockings, filled it, tied
the opening at the top with a string&mdash;plunged
stocking and all into a pail full of water and proceeded
to pour the contents into the well.</p>
<p>Just as the dark circle had closed over the blue
stocking, Joe Devins&#8217; face peered down the depths
by her side, and his voice sounded out the words:
&#8220;O Mother Moulton, the British will search the
wells the <i>very</i> first thing. Of course, they <i>expect</i>
to find things in wells!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you tell me before, Joe? but now
it is too late.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would, if I had known what you was going
to do; they&#8217;d been a sight safer in the honey
tree.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and what a fool I&#8217;ve been&mdash;flung <i>my watch</i>
into the well with the spoons!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well! Don&#8217;t stand there, looking!&#8221; as
she hovered over the high curb, with her hand on
the bucket. &#8220;Everybody will know, if you do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Martha! Martha!&#8221; shrieked Uncle John&#8217;s
quavering voice from the house door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bless my heart!&#8221; she exclaimed, hurrying
back over the stones.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with your heart?&#8221; questioned
Joe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing. I was thinking of Uncle John&#8217;s
money,&#8221; she answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Has he got money?&#8221; cried Joe. &#8220;I thought
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
he was poor, and you took care of him because
you were so good!&#8221;</p>
<p>Not one word that Joe uttered did the little
woman hear. She was already by Uncle John&#8217;s
side and asking him for the key to his strong box.</p>
<p>Uncle John&#8217;s rheumatism was terribly exasperating.
&#8220;No, I won&#8217;t give it to you!&#8221; he cried,
&#8220;and nobody shall have it as long as I am above
ground.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then the soldiers will carry it off,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let &#8217;em!&#8221; was his reply, grasping his staff
firmly with both hands and gleaming defiance out
of his wide, pale eyes. &#8220;<i>You</i> won&#8217;t get the key,
even if they do.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this instant, a voice at the doorway shouted
the words, &#8220;Hide, hide away somewhere, Mother
Moulton, for the Red Coats are in sight this minute!&#8221;</p>
<p>She heard the warning, and giving one glance
at Uncle John, which look was answered by
another &#8220;No, you won&#8217;t have it,&#8221; she grasped
Joe Devins by the collar of his jacket and thrust
him before her up the staircase so quickly that
the boy had no chance to speak, until she released
her hold, on the second floor, at the entrance to
Uncle John&#8217;s room.</p>
<p>The idea of being taken a prisoner in such a
manner, and by a woman, too, was too much for
the lad&#8217;s endurance. &#8220;Let me go!&#8221; he cried,
the instant he could recover his breath. &#8220;I won&#8217;t
hide away in your garret, like a woman, I won&#8217;t.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
I want to see the militia and the minute men fight
the troops, I do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Help me first, Joe. Here, quick now! Let&#8217;s
get this box out and up garret. We&#8217;ll hide it
under the corn and it&#8217;ll be safe,&#8221; she coaxed.</p>
<p>The box was under Uncle John&#8217;s bed.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s in the old thing anyhow?&#8221; questioned
Joe, pulling with all his strength at it.</p>
<p>The box, or chest, was painted red, and was
bound about by massive iron bands.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never seen the inside of it,&#8221; said Mother
Moulton. &#8220;It holds the poor old soul&#8217;s sole
treasure, and I <i>do</i> want to save it for him if I can.&#8221;</p>
<p>They had drawn it with much hard endeavor as
far as the garret stairs, but their united strength
failed to lift it. &#8220;Heave it, now!&#8221; cried Joe, and
lo! it was up two steps. So they turned it over
and over with many a thudding thump;&mdash;every one
of which thumps Uncle John heard and believed
to be strokes upon the box itself to burst it asunder&mdash;until
it was fairly shelved on the garret floor.</p>
<p>In the very midst of the overturnings, a voice
from below had been heard crying out, &#8220;Let my
box alone! Don&#8217;t you break it open! If you do,
I&#8217;ll&mdash;I&#8217;ll&mdash;&#8221; but, whatever the poor man <i>meant</i> to
threaten as a penalty, he could not think of anything
half severe enough to say, so left it uncertain
as to the punishment that might be looked for.</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor old soul!&#8221; ejaculated the little woman,
her soft white curls in disorder and the pink color
rising from her cheeks to her fair forehead, as she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
bent to help Joe drag the box beneath the rafter&#8217;s
edge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Joe,&#8221; she said, &#8220;we&#8217;ll heap nubbins
over it, and if the soldiers want corn they&#8217;ll take
good ears and never think of touching poor
nubbins.&#8221; So they fell to work throwing corn over
the red chest, until it was completely concealed
from view.</p>
<p>Then Joe sprang to the high-up-window ledge in
the point of the roof and took one glance out.
&#8220;Oh, I see them, the Red Coats! &#8217;Strue&#8217;s I live,
there go our militia <i>up the hill</i>. I thought they
was going to stand and defend. Shame on &#8217;em, I
say!&#8221; Jumping down and crying back to Mother
Moulton, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to stand by the minute
men,&#8221; he went down, three steps at a leap, and
nearly overturned Uncle John on the stairs, who,
with many groans, was trying to get to the defense
of his strong box.</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you help her for, you scamp?&#8221; he
demanded of Joe, flourishing his staff unpleasantly
near the lad&#8217;s head.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Cause she asked me to, and couldn&#8217;t do it
alone,&#8221; returned Joe, dodging the stick and
disappearing from the scene at the very moment
Martha Moulton encountered Uncle John.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your strong box is safe under nubbins in the
garret, unless the house burns down, and now that
you are up here, you had better stay,&#8221; she added
soothingly, as she hastened by him to reach the
kitchen below.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span></div>
<p>Once there, she paused a second or two to take
resolution regarding her next act. She knew full
well that there was not one second to spare, and
yet she stood looking, apparently, into the glowing
embers on the hearth. She was flushed and
excited, both by the unwonted toil and the
coming events. Cobwebs from the rafters had
fallen on her hair and homespun dress, and would
readily have betrayed her late occupation to any
discerning soldier of the king.</p>
<p>A smile broke suddenly over her fair face,
displacing for a brief second every trace of care.
&#8220;It&#8217;s my old weapon, and I must use it,&#8221; she said,
making a stately courtesy to an imaginary guest,
and straightway disappeared within an adjoining
room. With buttoned door and dropped curtains
the little woman made haste to array herself in her
finest raiment. In five minutes she reappeared in
the kitchen, a picture pleasant to look at. In all
New England, there could not be a more beautiful
little old lady than Martha Moulton was that day.
Her hair was guiltless now of cobwebs, but haloed
her face with fluffy little curls of silvery whiteness,
above which, like a crown, was a little cap of
dotted muslin, pure as snow. Her erect figure,
not a particle of the hard-working-day in it now,
carried well the folds of a sheeny, black silk gown,
over which she had tied an apron as spotless as
the cap.</p>
<p>As she fastened back her gown and hurried
away the signs of the breakfast she had not eaten,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
the clear pink tints seemed to come out with
added beauty of coloring in her cheeks, while her
hair seemed fairer and whiter than at any moment
in her three-score and eleven years.</p>
<p>Once more, Joe Devins looked in. As he caught
a glimpse of the picture she made, he paused to
cry out: &#8220;All dressed up to meet the robbers!
My, how fine you do look! I wouldn&#8217;t. I&#8217;d go
and hide behind the nubbins. They&#8217;ll be here in
less than five minutes now,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;and I&#8217;m
going over the North Bridge to see what&#8217;s going
on there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O Joe, stay, won&#8217;t you?&#8221; she urged, but the
lad was gone, and she was left alone to meet the
foe, comforting herself with the thought, &#8220;They&#8217;ll
treat me with more respect if I <i>look</i> respectable,
and if I <i>must</i> die, I&#8217;ll die good-looking in my best
clothes, anyhow.&#8221;</p>
<p>She threw a few sticks of hickory-wood on the
embers and then drew out the little round stand,
on which the family Bible was always lying.
Recollecting that the British soldiers probably
belonged to the Church of England, she hurried
away to fetch Uncle John&#8217;s &#8220;prayer book.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll have respect to me, if they find me
reading that, I know,&#8221; she thought. Having
drawn the round stand within sight of the well,
and where she could also command a view of the
staircase, she sat and waited for coming events.</p>
<p>Uncle John was keeping watch of the advancing
troops from an upper window. &#8220;Martha,&#8221; he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
called, &#8220;you&#8217;d better come up. They&#8217;re close
by, now.&#8221; To tell the truth, Uncle John himself
was a little afraid; that is to say, he hadn&#8217;t quite
courage enough to go down and, perhaps, encounter
his own rheumatism and the king&#8217;s soldiers on
the same stairway, and yet, he felt that he must
defend Martha as well as he could.</p>
<p>The rap of a musket, quick and ringing, on the
front door, startled the little woman from her
apparent devotions. She did not move at the
call of anything so profane. It was the custom of
the time to have the front door divided into two
parts, the lower half and the upper half. The former
was closed and made fast, the upper could be
swung open at will.</p>
<p>The soldier getting no reply, and doubtless
thinking that the house was deserted, leaped over
the chained lower half of the door.</p>
<p>At the clang of his bayonet against the brass
trimmings, Martha Moulton groaned in spirit, for,
if there was any one thing that she deemed essential
to her comfort in this life, it was to keep spotless,
speckless and in every way unharmed, the
great knocker on her front door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good, sound English metal, too,&#8221; she thought,
&#8220;that an English soldier ought to know how to
respect.&#8221;</p>
<p>As she heard the tramp of coming feet she only
bent the closer over the Book of Prayer that lay
open on her knee. Not one word did she read or
see; she was inwardly trembling and outwardly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
watching the well and the staircase. But now,
above all other sounds, broke the noise of Uncle
John&#8217;s staff thrashing the upper step of the staircase,
and the shrill, tremulous cry of the old man,
defiant, doing his utmost for the defense of his
castle.</p>
<p>The fingers that lay beneath the book tingled
with desire to box the old man&#8217;s ears, for the policy
he was pursuing would be fatal to the treasure
in garret and in well; but she was forced to
silence and inactivity.</p>
<p>As the king&#8217;s troops, Major Pitcairn at their
head, reached the open door and saw the old lady,
they paused. What could they do but look, for a
moment, at the unexpected sight that met their
view: a placid old lady in black silk and dotted
muslin, with all the sweet solemnity of morning
devotion hovering about the tidy apartment and
seeming to centre at the round stand by which she
sat,&mdash;this pretty woman, with pink and white face
surmounted with fleecy little curls and crinkles
and wisps of floating whiteness, who looked up to
meet their gaze with such innocent, prayer-suffused
eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good morning, Mother,&#8221; said Major Pitcairn,
raising his hat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good morning, gentlemen and soldiers,&#8221; returned
Martha Moulton. &#8220;You will pardon my
not meeting you at the door, when you see that I
was occupied in rendering service to the Lord of
all.&#8221; She reverently closed the book, laid it on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
the table, and arose, with a stately bearing, to
demand their wishes.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re hungry, good woman,&#8221; spoke the commander,
&#8220;and your hearth is the only hospitable
one we&#8217;ve seen since we left Boston. With your
good leave I&#8217;ll take a bit of this,&#8221; and he stooped
to lift up the Johnny-cake that had been all this
while on the hearth.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I had something better to offer you,&#8221;
she said, making haste to fetch plates and knives
from the corner-cupboard, and all the while she
was keeping eye-guard over the well. &#8220;I&#8217;m
afraid the Concorders haven&#8217;t left much for you
to-day,&#8221; she added, with a soft sigh of regret, as
though she really felt sorry that such brave men
and good soldiers had fallen on hard times in the
ancient town. At the moment she had brought
forth bread and baked beans, and was putting
them on the table, a voice rang into the room,
causing every eye to turn toward Uncle John.
He had gotten down the stairs without uttering
one audible groan, and was standing, one step
above the floor of the room, brandishing and
whirling his staff about in a manner to cause
even rheumatism to flee the place, while at the
top of his voice he cried out:</p>
<p>&#8220;Martha Moulton, how <i>dare</i> you <i>feed</i> these&mdash;these&mdash;monsters&mdash;in
human form?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t mind him, gentlemen, <i>please</i> don&#8217;t,&#8221;
she made haste to say; &#8220;he&#8217;s old, <i>very</i> old;
eighty-five, his last birthday, and&mdash;a little hoity-toity
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
at times,&#8221; pointing deftly with her finger
in the region of the reasoning powers in her
own shapely head.</p>
<p>Summoning Major Pitcairn by an offer of a
dish of beans, she contrived to say, under cover
of it:</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, sir, I couldn&#8217;t go away and leave him;
he is almost distracted with rheumatism, and
this excitement to-day will kill him, I&#8217;m afraid.&#8221;</p>
<p>Advancing toward the staircase with bold and
soldierly front, Major Pitcairn said to Uncle John:</p>
<p>&#8220;Stand aside, old man, and we&#8217;ll hold you
harmless.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe you will, you red-trimmed
trooper, you,&#8221; was the reply; and, with a dexterous
swing of the wooden staff, he mowed off and
down three military hats.</p>
<p>Before any one had time to speak, Martha
Moulton, adroitly stooping, as though to recover
Major Pitcairn&#8217;s hat, which had rolled to her feet,
swung the stairway-door into its place with a
resounding bang, and followed up that achievement
with a swift turn of two large wooden
buttons, one high up, and the other low down, on
the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; she said, &#8220;he is safe out of mischief
for a while, and your heads are safe as well. Pardon
a poor old man, who does not know what he
is about.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He seems to know remarkably well,&#8221; exclaimed
an officer.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span></div>
<p>Meanwhile, behind the strong door, Uncle
John&#8217;s wrath knew no bounds. In his frantic
endeavors to burst the fastenings of the wooden
buttons, rheumatic cramps seized him and carried
the day, leaving him out of the battle.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a company of soldiers clustered
about the door. The king&#8217;s horses were fed within
five feet of the great brass knocker, while,
within the house, the beautiful little old woman,
in her Sunday-best-raiment, tried to do the dismal
honors of the day to the foes of her country.
Watching her, one would have thought she was
entertaining heroes returned from the achievement
of valiant deeds, whereas, in her own heart,
she knew full well that she was giving a little, to
save much.</p>
<p>Nothing could exceed the seeming alacrity
with which she fetched water from the well for
the officers: and, when Major Pitcairn gallantly
ordered his men to do the service, the little soul
was in alarm; she was so afraid that &#8220;somehow,
in some way or another, the blue stocking would
get hitched on to the bucket.&#8221; She knew that
she must to its rescue, and so she bravely
acknowledged herself to have taken a vow (when,
she did not say), to draw all the water that was
taken from that well.</p>
<p>&#8220;A remnant of witchcraft!&#8221; remarked a soldier
within hearing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do I look like a witch?&#8221; she demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you do,&#8221; replied Major Pitcairn, &#8220;I admire
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
New England witches, and never would condemn
one to be hung, or burned, or&mdash;smothered.&#8221;</p>
<p>Martha Moulton never wore so brilliant a color
on her aged cheeks as at that moment. She felt
bitter shame at the ruse she had attempted, but
silver spoons were precious, and, to escape the
smile that went around at Major Pitcairn&#8217;s words,
she was only too glad to go again to the well and
dip slowly the high, over-hanging sweep into the
cool, clear, dark depth below.</p>
<p>During this time the cold, frosty morning
spent itself into the brilliant, shining noon.</p>
<p>You know what happened at Concord on that
19th of April in the year 1775. You have been
told the story&mdash;how the men of Acton met and
resisted the king&#8217;s troops at the old North Bridge;
how brave Captain Davis and minute-man Hosmer
fell; how the sound of their falling struck down
to the very heart of mother earth, and caused her
to send forth her brave sons to cry &#8220;Liberty, or
Death!&#8221;</p>
<p>And the rest of the story; the sixty or more
barrels of flour that the king&#8217;s troops found and
struck the heads from, leaving the flour in condition
to be gathered again at nightfall, the arms
and powder that they destroyed, the houses they
burned; all these, are they not recorded in every
child&#8217;s history in the land?</p>
<p>While these things were going on, for a brief
while, at mid-day, Martha Moulton found her
home deserted. She had not forgotten poor,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
suffering, irate Uncle John in the regions above,
and so, the very minute she had the chance, she
made a strong cup of catnip tea (the real tea, you
know, was brewing in Boston harbor).</p>
<p>She turned the buttons, and, with a bit of
trembling at her heart, such as she had not felt
all day, she ventured up the stairs, bearing
the steaming peace-offering before her.</p>
<p>Uncle John was writhing under the sharp
thorns and twinges of his old enemy, and in no
frame of mind to receive any overtures in the
shape of catnip tea; nevertheless, he was watching,
as well as he was able, the motions of the enemy.
As she drew near, he cried out:</p>
<p>&#8220;Look out this window, and see! Much <i>good</i>
all your scheming will do <i>you</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>She obeyed his command to look, and the sight
she then saw caused her to let fall the cup of
catnip tea and rush down the stairs, wringing her
hands as she went, and crying out:</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dear! what shall I do? The house will
burn and the box up garret. Everything&#8217;s lost!&#8221;</p>
<p>Major Pitcairn, at that moment, was on the
green in front of her door, giving orders.</p>
<p>Forgetting the dignified part she intended to
play; forgetting everything but the supreme danger
that was hovering in mid-air over her home&mdash;the
old house wherein she had been born, and the
only home she had ever known&mdash;she rushed out
upon the green, amid the troops and surrounded
by cavalry, and made her way to Major Pitcairn.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span></div>
<p>&#8220;The court-house is on fire!&#8221; she cried, laying
her hand upon the commander&#8217;s arm.</p>
<p>He turned and looked at her. Major Pitcairn
had recently learned that the task he had been
set to do in the provincial towns that day was not
an easy one; that, when hard pressed and trodden
down, the despised rustics, in homespun
dress, could sting even English soldiers; and thus
it happened that, when he felt the touch of
Mother Moulton&#8217;s plump little old fingers on his
military sleeve, he was not in the pleasant humor
that he had been when the same hand had ministered
to his hunger in the early morning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what of it? <i>Let it burn!</i> We won&#8217;t
hurt <i>you</i>, if you go in the house and stay there!&#8221;</p>
<p>She turned and glanced up at the court-house.
Already flames were issuing from it. &#8220;Go in the
house and let it burn, <i>indeed</i>!&#8221; thought she.
&#8220;He knows <i>me</i>, don&#8217;t he? Oh, sir! for the love
of Heaven won&#8217;t you stop it?&#8221; she said, entreatingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Run in the house, good mother. That is a
wise woman,&#8221; he advised.</p>
<p>Down in her heart, and as the very outcome of
lip and brain she wanted to say, &#8220;You needn&#8217;t
&#8216;mother&#8217; me, you murderous rascals!&#8221; but, remembering
everything that was at stake, she
crushed her wrath and buttoned it in as closely as
she had Uncle John behind the door in the morning,
and again, with swift gentleness, laid her
hand on his arm.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span></div>
<p>He turned and looked at her. Vexed at her
persistence, and extremely annoyed at intelligence
that had just reached him from the North Bridge,
he said, imperiously, &#8220;Get away! or you&#8217;ll be
trodden down by the horses!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I <i>can&#8217;t</i> go!&#8221; she cried, clasping his arm, and
fairly clinging to it in her frenzy of excitement.
&#8220;Oh, stop the fire, quick, quick! or my house will
burn!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no time to put out your fires,&#8221; he said,
carelessly, shaking loose from her hold and turning
to meet a messenger with news.</p>
<p>Poor little woman! What could she do? The
wind was rising, and the fire grew. Flame was
creeping out in a little blue curl in a new place,
under the rafter&#8217;s edge, <i>and nobody cared</i>. That
was what increased the pressing misery of it all.
It was so unlike a common country alarm, where
everybody rushed up and down the streets, crying
&#8220;Fire! fire! f-i-r-e!&#8221; and went hurrying to
and fro for pails of water to help put it out.</p>
<p>Until that moment the little woman did not
know how utterly deserted she was.</p>
<p>In very despair, she ran to her house, seized
two pails, filled them with greater haste than she
had ever drawn water before, and, regardless of
Uncle John&#8217;s imprecations, carried them forth,
one in either hand, the water dripping carelessly
down the side breadths of her fair silk gown, her
silvery curls tossed and tumbled in white confusion,
her pleasant face aflame with eagerness, and
her clear eyes suffused with tears.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span></div>
<p>Thus equipped with facts and feeling, she once
more appeared to Major Pitcairn.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you a mother in old England?&#8221; she
cried. &#8220;If so, for her sake, stop this fire.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her words touched his heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;And if I do&mdash;?&#8221; he answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Then your johnny-cake on my hearth won&#8217;t burn
up</i>,&#8221; she said, with a quick little smile, adjusting
her cap.</p>
<p>Major Pitcairn laughed, and two soldiers, at his
command, seized the pails and made haste to the
court-house, followed by many more.</p>
<p>For awhile the fire seemed victorious, but, by
brave effort, it was finally overcome, and the
court-house saved.</p>
<p>At a distance Joe Devins had noticed the smoke
hovering like a little cloud, then sailing away still
more like a cloud over the town; and he had
made haste to the scene, arriving in time to venture
on the roof, and do good service there.</p>
<p>After the fire was extinguished, he thought of
Martha Moulton, and he could not help feeling a
bit guilty at the consciousness that he had gone
off and left her alone.</p>
<p>Going to the house he found her entertaining
the king&#8217;s troopers with the best food her humble
store afforded.</p>
<p>She was so charmed with herself, and so utterly
well pleased with the success of her pleading,
that the little woman&#8217;s nerves fairly quivered
with jubilation; and best of all, the blue stocking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
was still safe in the well, for had she not watched
with her own eyes every time the bucket was
dipped to fetch up water for the fire, having,
somehow, got rid of the vow she had taken regarding
the drawing of the water.</p>
<p>As she saw the lad looking, with surprised
countenance, into the room where the feast was
going on, a fear crept up her own face and darted
out from her eyes. It was, lest Joe Devins should
spoil it all by ill-timed words.</p>
<p>She made haste to meet him, basket in hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, Joe,&#8221; she said, &#8220;fetch me some small
wood, there&#8217;s a good boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>As she gave him the basket she was just in
time to stop the rejoinder that was issuing from
his lips.</p>
<p>In time to intercept his return she was at the
wood-pile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Joe,&#8221; she said, half-abashed before the truth
that shone in the boy&#8217;s eyes&mdash;&#8220;Joe,&#8221; she repeated,
&#8220;you know Major Pitcairn ordered the fire put
out, <i>to please me</i>, because I begged him so, and, in
return, what <i>can</i> I do but give them something to
eat? Come and help me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t,&#8221; responded he. &#8220;Their hands are
red with blood. They&#8217;ve killed two men at the
bridge.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s killed?&#8221; she asked, trembling, but Joe
would not tell her. He demanded to know what
had been done with Uncle John.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s quiet enough, up-stairs,&#8221; she replied,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
with a sudden spasm of feeling that she <i>had</i> neglected
Uncle John shamefully; still, with the day,
and the fire and everything, how could she help
it? but, really, it did seem strange that he made
no noise, with a hundred armed men coming and
going through the house.</p>
<p>At least, that was what Joe thought, and, having
deposited the basket of wood on the threshold
of the kitchen door, he departed around the corner
of the house. Presently he had climbed a pear
tree, dropped from one of its overhanging
branches on the lean-to, raised a sash and crept
into the window.</p>
<p>Slipping off his shoes, heavy with spring mud,
he proceeded to search for Uncle John. He was
not in his own room; he was not in the guest-chamber;
he was not in any one of the rooms.</p>
<p>On the floor, by the window in the hall, looking
out upon the green, he found the broken cup
and saucer that Martha Moulton had let fall.
Having made a second round, in which he investigated
every closet and penetrated into the
spaces under beds, Joe thought of the garret.</p>
<p>Tramp, tramp went the heavy feet on the
sanded floors below, drowning every possible
sound from above; nevertheless, as the lad opened
the door leading into the garret, he whispered
cautiously: &#8220;Uncle John! Uncle John!&#8221;</p>
<p>All was silent above. Joe went up, and was
startled by a groan. He had to stand a few
seconds, to let the darkness grow into light, ere
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
he could see; and, when he could discern outlines
in the dimness, there was given to him the
picture of Uncle John, lying helpless amid and
upon the nubbins that had been piled over his
strong box.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Uncle John, are you dead?&#8221; asked Joe,
climbing over to his side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is the house afire?&#8221; was the response.</p>
<p>&#8220;House afire? No! The confounded Red
Coats up and put it out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought they was going to let me burn to
death up here!&#8221; groaned Uncle John.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I help you up?&#8221; and Joe proffered two
strong hands, rather black with toil and smoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no! You can&#8217;t help me. If the house
isn&#8217;t afire, I&#8217;ll stand it till the fellows are gone,
and then, Joe, you fetch the doctor as quick as
you can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>You</i> can&#8217;t get a doctor for love nor money this
night, Uncle John. There&#8217;s too much work to be
done in Lexington and Concord to-night for
wounded and dying men; and there&#8217;ll be more of
&#8217;em too afore a single Red Coat sees Boston again.
They&#8217;ll be hunted down every step of the way.
They&#8217;ve killed Captain Davis, from Acton.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t say so!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, they have, and&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I say, Joe Devins, go down and do&mdash;do something.
There&#8217;s <i>my niece</i> a-feeding the murderers!
I&#8217;ll disown her. She shan&#8217;t have a penny of my
pounds, she shan&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span></div>
<p>Both Joe and Uncle John were compelled to
remain in inaction, while below, the weary little
woman acted the kind hostess to His Majesty&#8217;s
troops.</p>
<p>But now the feast was spent, and the soldiers
were summoned to begin their painful march.
Assembled on the green, all was ready, when
Major Pitcairn, remembering the little woman
who had ministered to his wants, returned to the
house to say farewell.</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas but a step to her door, and but a moment
since he had left it, but he found her crying; crying
with joy, in the very chair where he had
found her at prayers in the morning.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would like to say good-by,&#8221; he said; &#8220;you&#8217;ve
been very kind to me to-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a quick dash or two of the dotted white
apron (spotless no longer) to her eye, she arose.
Major Pitcairn extended his hand, but she folded
her own closely together, and said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you a pleasant journey back to Boston,
sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you not shake hands with me before I
go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can feed the enemy of my country, but
shake hands with him, <i>never</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>For the first time that day the little woman&#8217;s
love of country seemed to rise triumphant within
her, and drown every impulse to selfishness; or,
was it the nearness to safety that she felt?
Human conduct is the result of so many motives
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
that it is sometimes impossible to name the compound,
although on that occasion Martha Moulton
labelled it &#8220;Patriotism.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet I put out the fire for you,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;For your mother&#8217;s sake, in old England, it
was, you remember, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember,&#8221; said Major Pitcairn, with a sigh,
as he turned away.</p>
<p>&#8220;And for <i>her</i> sake I will shake hands with
you,&#8221; said Martha Moulton.</p>
<p>So he turned back, and, across the threshold, in
presence of the waiting troops, the commander of
the expedition to Concord and the only woman
in the town shook hands at parting.</p>
<p>Martha Moulton saw Major Pitcairn mount his
horse; heard the order given for the march to
begin&mdash;the march of which you all have heard.
You know what a sorry time the Red Coats had of
it in getting back to Boston; how they were
fought at every inch of the way, and waylaid
from behind every convenient tree-trunk, and shot
at from tree-tops, and aimed at from upper windows,
and besieged from behind stone walls, and,
in short, made so miserable and harassed and
overworn, that at last their depleted ranks, with
the tongues of the men parched and hanging,
were fain to lie down by the road-side and take
what came next, even though it might be death.
And then <i>the dead</i> they left behind them!</p>
<p>Ah! there&#8217;s nothing wholesome to mind or
body about war, until long, long after it is over
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
and the earth has had time to hide the blood, and
send forth its sweet blooms of Liberty.</p>
<p>The men of that day are long dead. The same
soil holds regulars and minute-men. England,
which over-ruled, and the provinces, that put out
brave hands to seize their rights, are good friends
to-day, and have shaken hands over many a
threshold of hearty thought and kind deed since
that time.</p>
<p>The tree of Liberty grows yet, stately and fair,
for the men of the Revolution planted it well, and
surely, God himself <i>hath</i> given it increase. So we
gather to-day, in this our story, a forget-me-not
more, from the old town of Concord.</p>
<p>When the troops had marched away, the weary
little woman laid aside her silken gown, resumed
her homespun dress, and immediately began to
think of getting Uncle John down-stairs again
into his easy chair; but it required more aid than
she could give, to lift the fallen man. At last, Joe
Devins summoned returning neighbors, who came
to the rescue, and the poor nubbins were left to
the rats once more.</p>
<p>Joe climbed down the well and rescued the
blue stocking, with its treasures unharmed, even
to the precious watch, which watch was Martha
Moulton&#8217;s chief treasure, and one of the very few
in the town.</p>
<p>Martha Moulton was the heroine of the day.
The house was besieged by admiring men and
women that night and for two or three days thereafter;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
but when, years later, she being older, and
poorer, even to want, petitioned the General
Court for a reward for the service she rendered
in persuading Major Pitcairn to save the court-house
from burning, there was granted to her
only fifteen dollars, a poor little grant, it is true,
but <i>just enough</i> to carry her story down the years,
whereas, but for that, it might never have been
wafted up and down the land, on the wings of this
story.</p>

<a name='A_WINDHAM_LAMB_IN_BOSTON_TOWN' id='A_WINDHAM_LAMB_IN_BOSTON_TOWN'></a>
<h2>A WINDHAM LAMB IN BOSTON TOWN.</h2>
</div>
<p>It was one hundred and one years ago
in this very month of June, that nine
men of the old town of Windham&mdash;which
lies near the northeast corner
of Connecticut&mdash;met at the meeting-house door.
There was no service that day; the doors were
shut, and the bell in the steeple gave no sound.</p>
<p>The town of Windham had appointed the nine
men a committee to ask the inhabitants to give
from their flocks of sheep as many as they could
for the hungry men and women of Boston. Each
man of the committee was told at the meeting-house
door the district in which he was to gather
sheep.</p>
<p>On his stout grey pony sat Ebenezer Devotion.
As soon as he heard the eastern portion of the
town assigned to him, he gave the signal to his
horse, and in five minutes was out of sight over
the high hill. In ten minutes he was near the
famous Frog pond. As he was passing it by, a
voice from the marsh along its bank cried out:</p>
<p>&#8220;Where now, so fast, this fine morning, Mr.
Devotion?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The same to you, Goodwife Elderkin. I know
your voice, though I can&#8217;t see your face.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span></div>
<p>Presently a hand parted the thicket and a
woman&#8217;s face appeared.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m getting flag-root. It gives a twang to
root beer that nothing else will, and the flag hereabout
is the twangiest I know of. Stop at the
house as you go along and get some beer, won&#8217;t
you? Mary Ann&#8217;s to home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Mr. Devotion, with a stiff
bow. &#8220;It&#8217;s a little early for beer this morning.
I&#8217;ll stop as I come this way again. How are your
sheep and lambs this year?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;First rate. Never better.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you any to part with?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who wants to buy?&#8221; and Goodwife Elderkin
came out from the thicket to the road-side, eager
for gain.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t sell sheep in Windham this year,&#8221;
said Mr. Devotion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, what&#8217;s the matter with the man?&#8221;
thought Mrs. Elderkin, for Ebenezer Devotion
liked to drive a good bargain as well as any one
of his neighbors. Before she had time to give
expression to her surprise, he said with a sharp
inclination of his head toward the sun, &#8220;We&#8217;ve
neighbors over yonder, good and true, who
wouldn&#8217;t sell sheep if we were shut in by ships of
war, and hungry, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What! any news from Boston town?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s twenty-four days, to-day, since the port
was shut up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Goodwife Elderkin laughed. Ebenezer Devotion
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
looked grim enough to smother every bit of
laughter in New England.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Pears as if king and Parliament really believed
that tea was cast away by the men of Boston, now
don&#8217;t it? &#8217;stead of every man, woman and child
in the country havin&#8217; a hand in it,&#8221; said Mrs. Elderkin.</p>
<p>&#8220;About the sheep!&#8221; replied Mr. Devotion, jerking
up his horse&#8217;s head from the sweet, pure grass,
greening all the road-side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let your pony feed while he can,&#8221; she replied.
&#8220;What about the sheep?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How many will you give?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How many are you going to give yourself?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Twice as many as you will.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll give every sheep I own.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And how many is that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A couple of dozen or so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Better keep some of them for another time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Elderkin laughed again. &#8220;I&#8217;ll say half a
dozen then, if a dozen is all you want to give
yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ebenezer Devotion drew from his wallet a slip
of paper and headed his list of names with &#8220;Six
sheep, from Goodwife Elderkin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you in the name of God Almighty and
the country,&#8221; he said, solemnly, as he jerked his
pony&#8217;s head from the grass and rode on.</p>
<p>Mrs. Elderkin watched him as he wound along
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
the pond-side and was lost to sight; then she,
chuckling forth the words, &#8220;I knew well enough
my sheep were safe,&#8221; went back to the marsh after
flag-root.</p>
<p>When every neighbor feels it a duty to carry
intelligence from the last speaker he has met to
the next hearer he may meet, news flies fast, so
Goodwife Elderkin was prepared for the accost
of Mr. Devotion. She did not linger long in the
swamp, but, washing her hands free from mud in
the water of the pond, walked swiftly home. By
the time she reached her house, the gray pony
and his rider were two miles away on the road
to Canterbury. The cry of hunger and possible
starvation in the town of Boston was spreading
from village to village and from house to
house.</p>
<p>Do you know how Boston is situated? It
would be an island but for the narrow neck of
land on the south side. On the east, west and
north are the waters of Massachusetts Bay and
Charles River. Just north from it, and divided
only by the same river, is another almost island,
with its neck stretched toward the north; and
this latter place is Charlestown and contains
Bunker&#8217;s Hill. Not far from the two towns, in the
bay, are many islands. Noddle&#8217;s Island, Hog,
Snake, Deer, Apple, Bird and Spectacle Islands
are of the number. On these islands were many
sheep and cattle, likewise hay and wood, all of
which the inhabitants of Boston needed for daily
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
use, but by the Boston port bill, which went into
operation on the first day of June, no person was
permitted to land anything at either Boston or
Charlestown; and so the neck of Charlestown
reached out to the north for food and help, and
the neck of Boston pleaded with the south for
sustenance, and it was in answer to this cry that
our nine men of Windham went sheep-gathering.</p>
<p>The work went on for four days, and at the end
of that time 257 sheep had been freely given. The
owners drove them, on the evening of the 27th
day of the month, to the appointed place, and,
very early in the morning of the 28th, many of
the inhabitants were come together to see the
flock start on its long march. Two men and two
boys went with the gift. Good wife Elderkin was
early on the highway. She wanted to make certain
just how many sheep bore the mark of Ebenezer
Devotion&#8217;s ownership; but the driven sheep
went past too quickly for her, and she never had
the satisfaction of finding out how many he gave.
Following the flock up the hill, she saw in the
distance a sight that made her heart beat fast.
On the stone wall, under a great tree, sat Mary
Robbins, a little girl. She was dressed in a pink
calico frock, and she was holding in her arms a
snow-white lamb, around whose neck she had tied
a strip of the calico of which her own gown was
fashioned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now if I ever saw the beat of that!&#8221; cried
Good wife Elderkin, walking almost at a run up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
the hill, and so coming to the place where the
child sat, before the sheep got there.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mary Robbins!&#8221; she cried, breathless from her
haste. &#8220;What have you got that lamb for?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mary blushed under her little sun-bonnet,
hugged the lamb, and said not a word. At the
moment up came the flock, panting and warm.
Down sprang Mary Robbins from the wall, the
lamb in her arms. Johnny Manning, aged fifteen
years, was one of the two lads in care of the sheep.
To him Mary ran, saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;Johnny, Johnny, won&#8217;t you take my lamb, too?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, for some poor little girl in the town
where there isn&#8217;t anything to eat,&#8221; urged Mary,
her sun-bonnet falling unheeded into the dust, as
she held up her offering to the cause of liberty.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, it can&#8217;t walk to Boston,&#8221; said the boy,
running back to recover a stray sheep.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can carry it in your arms,&#8221; she urged.</p>
<p>&#8220;Give it to me, then.&#8221;</p>
<p>She gave it, saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;Be good to it, Johnny, and give him some milk
to drink to-night. It don&#8217;t eat much grass, yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so Johnny Manning marched away, over
and down and out of sight, with Mary&#8217;s lamb
in his arms. As for Mary herself, little woman
that she was, having made her sacrifice, she would
have dropped on the grass, after picking up her
sun-bonnet, and had a good cry over her loss, had
it not been for Goodwife Elderkin standing there
in the road, waiting for her.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span></div>
<p>With a sharp look at the child, the woman left
the highway to go to her own house, and Mary
went home, hoping that no one would ask her
about the lamb.</p>
<p>The flock of sheep marched until the noontide,
when a halt was ordered. After that they went
onward over hill and river, with rest at night and
at noon, until the town of Roxbury was reached.
At this place the sheep were left to be taken to
Boston, when opportunity could be had.</p>
<p>With Mary&#8217;s lamb in his arms, Johnny Manning
accompanied the messenger who went up Boston
Neck to carry a letter to the &#8220;Selectmen of the
Town.&#8221; That letter has been preserved and is
carefully kept among the treasured documents of
the Massachusetts Historical Society. It is too
long to be given here, but, after begging Boston
to suffer and be strong, remembering what had
been done for the country by its founders, it
closes in these words: &#8220;We know you suffer, and
feel for you. As a testimony of our commiseration
of your misfortunes, we have procured a
small flock of sheep, which at this season are not
so good as we could wish, but are the best we
had. This small present, gentlemen, we beg you
would accept and apply to the relief of those honest,
industrious poor, who are most oppressed by the
late oppressive acts.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, after a promise of future help in case of
need, the letter is signed by Samuel Grey,
Ebenezer Devotion, and seven other names, ending
with that of Hezekiah Manning.</p>

</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span></div>
<p>A British officer, seeing the lamb in Johnny&#8217;s
arms, offered to buy it, bribing him with a bit of
gold; but Johnny said &#8220;there wasn&#8217;t any gold in
the land that he would exchange it for,&#8221; and so the
lamb reached Boston in safety before the sheep
got there. As Johnny walked along the streets
he was busy looking out for some poor little girl
to give it to, according to Mary&#8217;s request.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must wait,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;until I find some
one who is almost starved.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the Common side he met a little girl who
cried &#8220;Oh! see! see! A lamb! A live lamb in
Boston Town!&#8221;</p>
<p>The child&#8217;s eyes rested on the little white
creature, which accosted her with a plaintive bleat.
Johnny Manning&#8217;s eyes were riveted on the little
girl. What he thought, he never said. &#8220;Do you
want it?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;O yes! yes! Where did you get it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve brought it from Roxbury in my arms.
Mary Robbins gave it, in Windham, for some
poor little girl who was hungry in Boston.
Are you hungry?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the child, hesitatingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you poor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My father is&#8221;&mdash;a sudden thought stopped the
words she was about to speak. &#8220;Give me the
lamb,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll feed three hungry little
girls every day as long as Boston is shut up. I
will! I will! and Mary&#8217;s lamb shall live until I&#8217;m
a hungry little girl myself, and I will keep it
until I am starved clear almost to death.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span></div>
<p>Johnny put Mary&#8217;s little lamb on the walk.
&#8220;See if it will follow you,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come lamb! lamb! come with Catharine,&#8221;
and it went bleating after her along the Common
side.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s used to a girl,&#8221; ejaculated the boy, &#8220;and
it hasn&#8217;t been a bit happy with me. Give it grass
and milk,&#8221; he called after Catharine, who turned
and bowed her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;A pretty story I shall have to tell Mary
Robbins,&#8221; thought Johnny. &#8220;Here I have given
her lamb to be kept and coddled, and it&#8217;s likely
never eaten at all&mdash;but I know that little girl will
keep her word. She looks it&mdash;and she said she
would feed three little girls as long as Boston is
shut up, and that is more than the lamb could do.
I must recollect the very words, to tell Mary.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the <i>Boston Gazette</i> of July 4th, 1774,
reached the village of Windham, its inhabitants
were surprised at the following announcement,
more particularly as not one of them knew
where the <i>last sheep</i> came from:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Last week, were driven to the neighboring town of Roxbury
two hundred and fifty-eight sheep, a generous contribution of our
sympathizing brethren of the town of Windham, in the colony of
Connecticut; to be distributed for the employment or relief of
those who may be sufferers by means of the act of Parliament,
called the Boston Port Bill.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Johnny Manning, when he returned to Windham,
privately explained the matter to Mary
Robbins, by telling her that when the sheep were
numbered at Roxbury he counted in her lamb.</p>

<h2>HOW ONE BOY HELPED THE BRITISH TROOPS OUT OF BOSTON IN 1776.</h2>
</div>
<p>It was Commander-in-chief Washington&#8217;s
birthday, and it was Jeremy Jagger&#8217;s
birthday.</p>
<p>General Washington was forty-four
years old that birthday, a hundred years ago.
Jeremy Jagger was fourteen, and early in the
morning of the 22d of February, 1776, the General
and the lad were looking upon the same bit
of country, but from different positions. General
George Washington was reviewing his precious
little army for the thousandth time; the lad
Jeremy was looking from a hill upon the camp at
Cambridge, and from thence across the River
Charles over into Boston, which city had, for
many months, been held by the British soldiers.</p>
<p>At last Jeremy exclaimed: &#8220;I say, it&#8217;s too
chestnut-bur bad; it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you step on one?&#8221; questioned a tall, hard-handed,
earnest-faced man, who at the instant had
come up to the stone-wall on which Jeremy stood,
surveying the camp and its surroundings.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I didn&#8217;t,&#8221; retorted the lad; &#8220;but I wish
Boston was <i>paved</i> all over with chestnut-burs, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
that every pesky British officer in it had to walk
barefoot from end to end fourteen times a day, I
do; and the fourteenth time I&#8217;d order two or
three Colony generals to take a turn with &#8217;em.
General Gates for one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come along, Jeremy,&#8221; called his companion,
who had strode across the wall and gone on,
regardless of the boy&#8217;s words.</p>
<p>When Jeremy had ended his expressed wishes,
he gathered up his hatchet, dinner-basket, and
coil of stout cord, and plunged through the snow
after his leader.</p>
<p>When he had overtaken him, the impulsive lad&#8217;s
heart burst out at the lips with the words:
&#8220;<i>We</i> could take Boston <i>now</i>, just as easy as anything&mdash;without
wasting a jot of powder either.
Skip across the ice, don&#8217;t you see, and be right in
there before daylight. A big army lying still for
months and months, and just doing nothing but
wait for folks in Boston to starve out! I <i>say</i> it&#8217;s
shameful; now, too, when the ice has come that
General Washington has been waiting all winter
for.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t help your country one bit by
scolding about it, Jeremy. You&#8217;d better save
your strength for cutting willow-rods to-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d cut like a hurricane if the rods were only
going to whip the enemy with. But just for sixpence
a day&mdash;pshaw! I say, it don&#8217;t pay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, lad, can you keep a secret?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Trust me for that,&#8221; returned Jeremy. Turning
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
suddenly upon his questioner, he faced him
to listen to a supposed bit of information.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then why on earth are you talking to <i>me</i> in
that manner, boy?&#8221; questioned the man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why you <i>know</i> all about it, just as well as I
do; and a fellow <i>must</i> speak out in the woods or
<i>somewhere</i>. Why, I get so mad and hot sometimes
that it seems as if every thought in me would
burn right out on my face, when I think about
my poor mother over there,&#8221; pointing backward
to the three-hilled city.</p>
<p>The two were standing at the moment midway
of a corn-field. The February wind was lifting
and rustling and shaking rudely the withered
corn-stalks, with their dried leaves. To the
northward lay the Cambridge camp, across the
Charles River. To the south and east, just over
Muddy River and Stony Brook, lay the right
wing of the American Army, with here a fort and
there a redoubt stretching at intervals all the
distance between the camp at Cambridge and
Dorchester Neck, on the southeast side of Boston.
Behind them, to the westward, lay Cedar Swamp,
while not more than half a mile to the front there
was a four-gun battery and Brookline Fort, on
the Charles, near by.</p>
<p>While Jeremy Jagger was pouring forth his
words with vociferous violence, the man by his
side glanced eagerly about the wide field; but,
satisfying himself that no one was within hearing,
he said, resting his hatchet on the lad&#8217;s shoulder
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
while speaking: &#8220;See here, my boy. The brave
man never boasts of his bravery nor the trustworthy
man of his trustworthiness. How you
learned what you know of the plans of General
Washington I do not care to ask; but to-day and
all days keep quiet and show yourself worthy of
being trusted.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try as hard as I can,&#8221; promised Jeremy.</p>
<p>&#8220;No one can have tried his best without
accomplishing something that it was grand to do,
though not always <i>just what</i> he was trying to do,&#8221;
responded the man, glancing kindly down upon
the fresh, eager lad, tramping through the snow,
at his side. &#8220;Don&#8217;t forget. &#8216;Silence is golden,&#8217;
in war always. Not a word, mind, when you get
home, about the work of to-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were come now to a spot where the
marsh seemed to be filled with sounds of wood-cutting.
As they plunged into Cedar Swamp,
the sounds grew nearer and multiplied. It was
like the rapid firing of muskets.</p>
<p>Running through the swamp there was a trout-brook,
that bore along its borders a dense growth
of water-willows.</p>
<p>And now they advanced within sight of at least
two hundred men and boys, every one of whom
worked away as though his life depended on
cutting a certain amount of willow-boughs in a
given time.</p>
<p>&#8220;What does it all mean?&#8221; questioned Jeremy.</p>
<p>&#8220;It means,&#8221; replied his companion, &#8220;work for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
your country to-day with all your might and
main.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, pray tell me,&#8221; persisted Jeremy, &#8220;what
under the sun the things are for, anyway.
They&#8217;re good for nothing for fire-wood, green.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Wooster turned and looked at the lad and
said: &#8220;A good soldier asks no questions and
marches, without knowing whither. He also cuts,
without knowing for what. Now, to work!&#8221; and,
at the instant they mingled with the workmen.</p>
<p>In less than a minute Jeremy&#8217;s dinner-basket
was swinging on a willow-bough, his coat was
hanging protectingly over it (you must remember
that it contained Jeremy Jagger&#8217;s birthday cake),
and the lad&#8217;s own arms were working away to
the musical sounds of a hatchet beating on a vast
amount of &#8220;whistle-stuff,&#8221; until mid-day and
hunger arrived in company.</p>
<p>At the signal for noon Jeremy Jagger began
his birthday feast. He perched himself on a
stout willow-branch, hanging the basket on a
conveniently growing peg at his right hand, and,
by frequent examination of the store within, was
able to solace two or three lads, less fortunate
than himself, who were taking the mid-day rest,
refreshed by plain bread and cheese, seated on a
branch, lower down on the same tree.</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t <i>every</i> day that a fellow eats his birthday
dinner in the woods,&#8221; he exclaimed, by way
of apology for the dainties he tossed down to
them in the shape of sugar-cake and &#8220;spice pie.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
&#8220;Aunt Hannah was pretty liberal with me this
morning. I wonder if she knew anything, for she
said: &#8216;I&#8217;d find plenty of squirrels to help eat it.&#8217;
Where do you live, anyway?&#8221; he questioned,
after he had fed them.</p>
<p>&#8220;We live in Brookline,&#8221; answered the elder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, do you know what under the sun we
are cutting such bundles of fagots for to-day?&#8221;
he slyly questioned, being beyond the hearing of
the ears of his friend, and so safe from censure.</p>
<p>&#8220;I asked father this morning,&#8221; spoke up the
younger lad (of not more than nine years), &#8220;and
he told me he guessed General Washington was
going to take Boston on the ice, and every soldier
was going to take a bundle of fagots along, so as
to keep from sinking if the ice broke through.&#8221;</p>
<p>This bit of military news was received with
shouts of laughter, that echoed from tree to tree
along the brook, and then the noon-day rest was
over. The wind began to blow in cooler and
faster from the sea, and busy hands were obliged
to work fast to keep from stiffening under the
power of the growing frost.</p>
<p>When the new moon hung low in the west and
the sun was gone, the brookside, the cart-path,
even the swamp fell back into its accustomed
silence, for the workers, in groups of eight or ten,
had from minute to minute gone homeward, leaving
<ins title='Was hugh'>huge</ins> piles of fagots near the log bridge.</p>
<p>Jeremy went early to bed that night. His
right arm was weary and his left arm ached;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
nevertheless, he went straightway to dreaming
that both arms were dragging his beloved mother
forth from Boston.</p>
<p>At midnight his companion of the morning
came and stood under his chamber window, and
tapped lightly with a bean-pole against the glass
to awaken him.</p>
<p>Jeremy heard the sound, but in his dream
thought it was a gun fired from one of the ships
in the harbor at his mother, and himself, and
Boston.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jeremy, get up!&#8221; said somebody, touching
his shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, mother!&#8221; ejaculated Jeremy, clutching
at the air and uttering the words under tremendous
pressure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come yourself, lad,&#8221; said somebody, shaking
him a little roughly; whereupon Jeremy awoke.
&#8220;Get up, Jeremy Jagger. Hitch the oxen to the
cart. Put on the hay-rigging. Stay, I must help
you to do that; but hurry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jeremy rubbed his eyes, wondered what had
become of his mother, and how Mr. Wooster
found his way into the house in the night, and
lastly, what was to be done. Furthermore, he
dressed with speed, and awakened the oxen by
vigorous touches and moving words.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get up! get up!&#8221; he importuned, &#8220;and work
for your country, and may be you won&#8217;t be
killed and eaten for your country when you are
old.&#8221; The large, patient eyes of the oxen slowly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
opened into the night, and after awhile the vigorous
strokes and voiceful &#8220;get ups&#8221; of their
master had due effect.</p>
<p>Mr. Wooster helped to adjust the hay-rigging,
and then the large-wheeled cart rolled grindingly
over the frozen ground of the highway, until it
turned into the path leading into the swamp, over
which the snow lay in unbroken surface. Jeremy
Jagger&#8217;s was but the pioneer cart that night. A
half-dozen rolled and tumbled and reeled over
the uneven surface behind him, to the log bridge.
It was cold and still. As the topmost fagot was
tossed on the pile in his cart he drew off a mitten,
thrust his benumbed fingers between his parted
lips, and when he removed them said: &#8220;I hope
General Washington has had a better birthday
than mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know one thing, my lad.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jeremy turned quickly, for he did not recognize
the voice. Even then he could not discern
the face; but he knew instantly that it was no
common person who had spoken. Nevertheless,
with that sturdy, good-as-anybody air that made
the men of April 19th and June 17th fight so
gloriously, he demanded:</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That General Washington would gladly
change places with you to-night, if you are the
honest lad you seem to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go and see him in his comfortable bed over
there in Cambridge,&#8221; was Jeremy&#8217;s response,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
uttered in the same breath with the word to his
oxen to move on. They moved on. The fagots
reeled and swayed, the cart rumbled over the
logs of the bridge, and boy, oxen and cart were
soon lost to sight and hearing in the cedar
thickets of the swamp.</p>
<p>Through the next two hours they toiled on,
Jeremy on foot, and often ready to lie down with
the healthy sleep that would not leave its hold on
his weary brain.</p>
<p>It was day-dawn when the fagots had been
duly delivered at the appointed place and Jeremy
reached home.</p>
<p>He had been cautiously bidden to see that the
cart was not left outside with its tell-tale rigging.
He obeyed the injunction, shut the oxen in, gave
them double allowance of hay, and was startled
by Aunt Hannah&#8217;s cheery call of: &#8220;Jerry, my
boy, come to breakfast.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Breakfast ready?&#8221; said Jeremy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes. I was up early this morning, and
thought of you.&#8221; And that was the only allusion
Aunt Hannah made to his night&#8217;s work. He
longed to tell her and chat about it all at the
table; but, remembering his promise in the
swamp, he said not a word.</p>
<p>Six nights out of seven Jeremy and his oxen
worked all night and slept nearly all day.</p>
<p>The brook in Cedar Swamp was robbed of its
willows, and many another bit of land and watercourse
suffered in a like manner.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span></div>
<p>Then came the order to make the fagots into
fascines. Two thousand soldiers were got to
work to effect this. Jeremy Jagger began to
understand what was going on behind the lines
at Roxbury. He was the happiest lad in existence
during the ensuing days. He forgot to eat,
even, when the fascines were in making. Perceiving
the manner in which they were formed
he volunteered to help, and soon found he could
drive the cross supports into the ground, lay the
saplings upon them, and even aid in twisting the
green withes about them, as well as any soldier
of them all.</p>
<p>Bales of &#8220;screwed&#8221; hay began to appear in
great numbers within the lines, and empty barrels
by the hundreds sprang up from somewhere.</p>
<p>And all this time, guess as every man might
and did&mdash;the coming event was known only to
the commander-in-chief and to the six generals
forming the council of war.</p>
<p>Monday night, before sundown, Jeremy Jagger
received an order. It was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class='sig2'><span class='smcap'>March 4th.</span></p>
<p><span class='smcap'>Jeremy Jagger</span>:</p>
<p>With oxen and cart (hay-rigging on), be at the
Roxbury lines by moon-rise to-night. Take a
pocketful of gingerbread along.</p>
<p class='sig2'><span class='smcap'>Wooster.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>With manly pride the boy set forth. He
longed to put the note in his aunt&#8217;s hand ere he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
went; but she (long ago it seemed, though only a
few days had passed) seemed to take no note of
his frequent absences. He had scarcely gone a
rod ere the cannon-balls began their march into
Boston from all the fortifications of the Americans;
and in return from Boston, flying north
and south and west, came shot and shells.</p>
<p>Undaunted and excited by the mere possibility
of being hit, Jeremy went onward. When he
arrived in Roxbury he found everybody and
everything astir. His cart was seized, filled with
bundles of &#8220;screwed&#8221; hay, and, ere he knew it,
he was in line with two hundred and ninety-nine
other carts, marching forward to fortify Dorchester
Heights. Before him went twelve hundred
troops, under the command of General Thomas;
before the troops trundled an unknown number
of carts, filled with intrenching tools; before the
tools were eight hundred men. Not a word was
spoken. In silence and with utmost care they
trod the way. At eight of the clock the covering
party of eight hundred reached the Height and
divided&mdash;one-half going toward the point nearest
Boston, the other to the point nearest Castle William,
on Castle Island, held by the British.</p>
<p>Then the working party began their labor with
enthusiasm unbounded, wondering what the British
general would think when he should behold
their work in the morning. They toiled in silence
by the light of the moon and the home music of
144 shot and 13 shell going into Boston, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
unnumbered shot and shell coming out of Boston.
Gridley, whose quick night work at Breed&#8217;s Hill
on the sixteenth of June had startled the world,
headed the intrenching party as engineer.</p>
<p>Poor Jeremy was not allowed to go farther
than Dorchester Neck with his first load. The
bundles of hay were tumbled out and laid in line,
to protect the supplying party, in case the work
going on on the hill beyond should be found out.</p>
<p>The next time, to his extreme delight, he found
that fascines were to go in his cart. When he
reached Dorchester Height quick work was made
of unloading his freight, and, without a word
spoken, he was ordered back with a move of the
hand.</p>
<p>Four times the lad and the oxen went up Dorchester
Hill that night. The fourth time, as no
order was given to return, Jeremy thought he
might as well stay and see the battle that would
begin with the dawn.</p>
<p>He left the oxen behind an embankment with a
big bundle of hay to the front of them; and after
five minutes devoted to gingerbread he went to
work. Morning would come long before they
were ready to have it unveil the growing forts to
the eyes of Admiral Shuldham, with his ships of
war lying in the harbor; or to the sentinels at
Castle William, on Castle Island, to the right of
them; or to General Howe, with his vigilant
thousands of Englishmen safe and snug in Boston,
to the north of them.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span></div>
<p>Jeremy was rolling barrels to the brow of the
hill they were fortifying, and tumbling into them
with haste shovelful after shovelful of good solid
earth, that they might hit hard when rolled down
on the foe that should dare to mount the height,
when a cautious voice at his side uttered the one
word &#8220;Look!&#8221; accompanied with a motion of
the hand toward Dorchester Neck.</p>
<p>In the moonlight, past the bales of hay, two
thousand Americans were filing in silent haste
to the relief of the men who had toiled all night
to build forts they meant to defend on the morrow.</p>
<p>It was four o&#8217;clock in the morning when they
came. Jeremy was tired and sleepy too. His
eyelids would drop over his eyes, shutting out
everything he so longed to keep in sight.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve worked like a hero,&#8221; said a kind voice
to the lad. &#8220;It will be hot work here by sunrise&mdash;no
place for boys, when the battle begins.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can fight,&#8221; stoutly persisted Jeremy, nodding
as he spoke; and, had anybody thought of
the lad at all after that, he might have been found
in the ox-cart, carelessly strewn over with hay,
taking a nap.</p>
<p>Meanwhile on came the morning. A friendly
fog hung lovingly around the new hills on the old
hills, that the Yankees had built in a night.</p>
<p>Admiral Shuldham was called in haste from his
bed by frightened men, who wondered what had
happened on Dorchester Height. Castle William
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
stood aghast with astonishment. Messengers
went up the bay to tell the army the news.</p>
<p>General Howe marched out to take a look
through the fog at the old familiar hills he had
known so long, and didn&#8217;t like the looks of the
new hats they wore. He wondered how in the
world the thing had been done without discovery;
but there it was, larger a good deal than life, seen
through the fog, and he knew also why it was that
the cannon had been playing on Boston through
the hours of three or four nights. He was angry,
astonished, perplexed. He had a little talk with
Admiral Shuldham; and they agreed to do something.
Yes, they <i>would</i> walk up and demand back
the hills looking over into Boston. Transports
came hurrying to pier and wharf, and soldiers
went bravely down and gave themselves to the
work of a short sea voyage.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Jeremy Jagger&#8217;s nap was broken by
a number of trenching tools thrown carelessly
over his back, as he lay asleep in his cart.</p>
<p>&#8220;Halloo there!&#8221; he shouted, striving to rise
from the not very comfortable blanket that dropped
in twain to the left and the right, as he shook
off the tools and returned from the land of sleep
to Dorchester Heights and the 5th of March.
He was just in time to hear a voice like a clarion
cry out: &#8220;Remember it is the 5th of March, and
avenge the death of your brethren.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was the very voice that had said in the
swamp in the night that &#8220;General Washington
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
would gladly change places with Jeremy Jagger.&#8221;
It was the voice of General Washington animating
the troops for the coming battle.</p>
<p>Meanwhile a new and unexpected force arrived
on the field of action. It came in from sea&mdash;a
great and mighty wind, that tossed and tumbled
the transports to and fro on the waves and would
not let them land anywhere save at the place they
came from. So they went peacefully back to
Boston, and the Liberty Men over on the hills
went on all day and all night, in the rain and the
wind, building up, strengthening, fortifying, in
fact getting ready, as Jeremy told his aunt, when
he reached home on the morning of the sixth of
March, &#8220;for a visit from King George and all
his army.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next day General Howe doubted and did
little. The next and the next went on and then
on the morning of the 17th of March something
new had happened. There was one little hill, so
near to Boston that it was almost in it; and lo!
in the night it had been visited by the Americans,
and a Liberty Cap perched above its head.</p>
<p>General Howe said: &#8220;We must get away from
here in haste.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Take us with you,&#8221; said a thousand Royalists
of the town; and he took them, bag and baggage,
to wander up and down the earth.</p>
<p>Over on Bunker Breed&#8217;s Hill wooden sentinels
did duty when the British soldiers left and for full
two hours after; and then two brave Yankees
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
guessed the men were wooden, and marched in
to take possession just nine months from the day
they bade it good-by, because they had no powder
with which to &#8220;tune&#8221; their guns.</p>
<p>Over on Cambridge Common marched, impatient
as ever, General Putnam, with his four
thousand followers, ready to cross the River
Charles and walk once more the city streets of
the good old town. On all the hills were
gathered men, women and children to see the
British troops depart.</p>
<p>Jeremy Jagger was up before the dawn on that
sweetest of Sunday mornings in March, and he
reached the Roxbury lines just as General Ward
was ready to put his arms about Boston&#8217;s Neck.
The lad took his place with the five hundred men
and walked by Ensign Richards&#8217; side, as he
proudly bore the standard up to the gates, which
Ebenezer Learned &#8220;unbarred and opened.&#8221; Once
within the lines, Jeremy, unmindful of the crow&#8217;s
feet strewn over the way, made haste through
lane and street to his old home on Beacon Hill.
&#8220;Could that be his mother looking out at him
through the window-pane?&#8221; he thought, as he
drew near.</p>
<p>She saw him. She knew him. But what could
it mean that she did not open the door to let him
in; that she waved him away? It could not be
that she, his own mother, had turned Tory, that
her face was grown so red and angry at the sight
of her son.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span></div>
<p>Jeremy banged away at the door. There was
no answer.</p>
<p>At last he heard the lifting of a sash, a head,
muffled carefully, appeared from the highest window
in the house, and a voice (the lad knew whose
it was) said: &#8220;Go, Jeremy! Go away out of Boston
as fast as you can. I&#8217;ll come to you as soon
as it is safe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, mother, what&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; cried the
boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Small pox! I&#8217;ve had it. Everybody has it.
Go!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-by,&#8221; cried Jeremy, running out of Boston
as fast as any British soldier of them all and
a good deal more frightened. He burst into
Aunt Hannah&#8217;s house with the news that he had
been to Boston, that the soldiers were all gone,
that he had seen his mother, that she had the
small-pox and sent him off in a hurry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tut! tut!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;It&#8217;s wicked to tell
lies, Jeremy Jagger.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not telling lies. Every word is true.
Please give me something to eat.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Aunt Hannah did not wait to give the lad
food, nor even to speak the prayer of thanksgiving
that went like incense from her heart. She
went into the barn-yard and threw corn on the
barn-floor, to which the hens and turkeys made
haste. Closing the door, she summoned Jeremy
to kill the largest and best of them.</p>
<p>That Sunday afternoon the brick oven glowed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
with fervent heat, the white, fat offerings went in,
and the golden-brown turkeys and chickens came
out; and as each, in turn, was pronounced &#8220;done,&#8221;
Aunt Hannah repeated the words: &#8220;Hungry!
hungry! hungry! Hungry all winter!&#8221;</p>
<p>The big clothes-basket was full of lint for
wounds that now never should be made. Gladly
she tossed out the fluffy mass, and packed within
it every dainty the house contained.</p>
<p>It was nearly sunset when Aunt Hannah and
Jeremy started forth, with the basket between
them, to Mr. Wooster&#8217;s house, hoping that he
would carry it in his wagon up to Boston. He
was not at home.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get out the cart,&#8221; said Aunt Hannah to
Jeremy, when they learned no help was to be
obtained. She sat by the roadside watching the
basket until the cart arrived.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going with you,&#8221; she said, after the basket
was in; she climbed to the seat beside the lad,
and off they started for Boston.</p>
<p>It was dark when they reached the lines, and
no passes granted, the officers said, to go in that
night.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;ve food for the hungry,&#8221; said Aunt
Hannah, in her sweetest voice, from the darkness
of the cart, &#8220;and folks are hungry in the night as
well as in the day.&#8221;</p>
<p>She deftly threw aside the cover from the
basket and took out a chicken, which she held
forth to the man, saying: &#8220;Take it. It&#8217;s good.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span></div>
<p>He hesitated a moment, then seized it eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you,&#8221; spoke up Jeremy, at this juncture.
&#8220;You went up the Neck with us this morning.
I saw you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you are the boy who got first into
Boston this morning, are you, sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe I did, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on.&#8221;</p>
<p>The oxen went on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Jeremy, down with you and wait here
for me. You haven&#8217;t had small-pox,&#8221; said Aunt
Hannah.</p>
<p>&#8220;But the oxen won&#8217;t mind you,&#8221; said Jeremy.</p>
<p>Aunt Hannah was troubled. She never had
driven oxen.</p>
<p>At the moment who should appear but Mr.
Wooster. He gladly offered to take the basket
and deliver it at Mrs. Jagger&#8217;s door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go in, mind! Mother&#8217;s had small-pox,&#8221;
called Jeremy, as he started.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m tired,&#8221; gasped Aunt Hannah, who had
done baking enough for a small army that day,
as she sat down to rest on the broad seat of the
cart, and the two started for home. The soldier
at the gate scarcely heeded them as they went
out, for roasted chicken &#8220;tasted so good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad the British are out of Boston,&#8221;
said Aunt Hannah, as she touched home soil
again and went wearily up the walk to the little
dark house.</p>
<p>&#8220;And so am I,&#8221; said Jeremy to the oxen, as he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
turned them in for the night; &#8220;only if I&#8217;d had
my way, they wouldn&#8217;t have gone without one
good fair fight. You&#8217;ve done your duty, anyhow,&#8221;
he added, soothingly, with a parting stroke
to the honest laborer who went in last, &#8220;and you
deserve well of your country, too, for like Gen.
Washington, you have served without hope of
reward. The thing I like best about the man is
that he don&#8217;t work for money. I don&#8217;t want my
sixpence a day for cutting willows; and&mdash;I won&#8217;t&mdash;take
it.&#8221; And he didn&#8217;t take it, consoling
himself with the reflection &#8220;that he would be like
Gen. Washington in one thing, anyhow.&#8221;</p>

<h2>PUSSY DEAN&#8217;S BEACON FIRE.
<span class='chsub'> <br /><br /><span class='smcap'>March 17, 1776.</span></span></h2>
</div>
<p>A hundred years ago the winds of
March were blowing.</p>
<p>To-day the same winds rush by the
stone memorials and sweep across the
low mounds that securely cover the men and the
women that then were alive to chill blast and
stirring event. Even the lads who gathered at
sound of drum and fife on village green, wishing,
as they saw the troopers march, that they were
men, and the little girls who hung about father&#8217;s
neck because he was going off to war, who
watched the post-riders on their course, wishing
that they knew the news he carried, are no longer
with us.</p>
<p>For nearly two years Boston had been the lost
town of the people. It had been taken from the
children by an unkind father and given to
strangers. You have been told how British ships
came and closed her harbor, so that food and
raiment could not enter. You know how grandly
the younger sister towns behaved toward stately,
hungry Boston; how they marched up the narrow
neck of land that holds back the town from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
the sea, each and every one bearing gifts to the
beloved town, until there came the sad and fatal
day wherein British military lines turned back
the tide of offerings and closed the gate of
entrance.</p>
<p>Then it was that friends began to gather across
the rivers that wound their waters around Boston.
Presently an army grew up and stationed
itself with leaders and banners and forts.</p>
<p>Summer came. The army waited through all
the long warm days. The summer went; the
leaves fell; the chill winds and the cold sea-fogs
wound into and out of the poor little tents and
struck the brave men who, having no tents, tried
to be strong and endure.</p>
<p>Every child knows, or ought to know, the story
of that winter; how day by day, all over New
England, men were striving to gather <ins title='Was fireams'>firearms</ins> and
powder wherewith to take back from the foe poor
Boston. But, alas, there was not powder enough
in all the land to do it.</p>
<p>The long, wearying winter had done its worst
for the prisoned inhabitants within the town; and,
truly, it had tried and pinched the waiting friends
who stood at the gates.</p>
<p>At last, in March, in the night, the brave
helpers climbed the hills, built on them smaller
hills, and by the light of the morning were able
to look over into the town&mdash;at which the patriots
were glad and the British commander frightened.</p>
<p>A little after nine of the clock on Sunday morning,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
the 17th of March, 1776, three Narragansett
ponies stood before General Washington&#8217;s headquarters
at Cambridge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go with all possible speed to Governor
Trumbull,&#8221; said Washington, delivering despatches
to a well-known and trusted messenger,
who instantly mounted one of the ponies in waiting&mdash;Sweeping
Wind by name&mdash;and rode away,
with many a sharp and inquiring glance back at
city and river and camp.</p>
<p>It was four of the clock in the afternoon, and
the messenger had not paused since he set forth,
longer than to give Sweeping Wind water to
drink, when, on the highway in the distance, he
saw a red cloak fluttering and flying before him.</p>
<p>It was Pussy Dean who wore the cloak. She
was fifteen, fair and lovely, brave and patriotic as
any soldier in the land.</p>
<p>At first she was angry at the law by which she
was denied a new cloak that winter, made of
English fabric, but when wrapped in the coveted
broadcloth of scarlet belonging to her mother she
was more than reconciled.</p>
<p>On this Sunday Pussy had been at the meeting-house
on the hill, two miles from home, at both
morning and afternoon service, and afterward had
lingered a little to gather up bits of news from
camp and town to take home to her mother, and
so it had happened that she was quite alone on
the highway.</p>
<p>Pussy chanced to look back to the summit of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
the hill down which she had walked, and she saw
the express coming.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; she thought, &#8220;if I could only stop
him! I wonder if I can&#8217;t. I&#8217;ll try, and then,&#8221;
swinging her silken bag, &#8220;I shall have news to
carry home, the very latest, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>As she swung the bag she suddenly remembered
that she had something within it to offer
the rider.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I can,&#8221; she went on saying to herself.
&#8220;Post-riders are always hungry, and it&#8217;s
lucky for him that I didn&#8217;t have to eat my dinner
myself, to-day. Now, if I only had a basketful of
clover heads or roses for that pony, I&#8217;d find out
all about Boston while it was eating.&#8221;</p>
<p>The only roses within sight were blooming on
Pussy Dean&#8217;s two cheeks as Sweeping Wind
came clattering his shoes against the frozen
ground. He would have gone straight on had a
scarlet cloak not been planted, like a fluttering
standard, full in his pathway.</p>
<p>The rider gave the pony the slightest possible
check, since he felt sure that no red-coated soldier
lurked behind the red cloak.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take something to eat, won&#8217;t you?&#8221; accosted
Pussy, rather glowing in feature and agitated in
voice by her own daring.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the rider had given Sweeping Wind
a second intimation to stand, which he obeyed,
and sniffed at Pussy&#8217;s cloak and cheeks and silken
bag as she held it forth to the rider, saying
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
naively, &#8220;I went to meeting and was invited to
luncheon, and so didn&#8217;t eat mine.&#8221; She spoke
swiftly, as though she knew she must not detain
him.</p>
<p>He answered with a smile and a &#8220;Thank you,&#8221;
took the bag, and rewarded her by saying, &#8220;The
British are getting out of Boston, bag and baggage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And where are you going?&#8221; demanded Pussy,
determined not to go home with but half the
story if she could help it.</p>
<p>&#8220;To Governor Trumbull with the good news
and a demand for two thousand men to save New
York,&#8221; he cried back, having gone on. His
words were entangled with a mouthful of gingerbread
or mince-pie to such an extent that it was
a full minute before Pussy understood their import,
and then she could only say over and over
to herself, as she hastened on, &#8220;Father will be
here, father will come home, and we&#8217;ll have the
good old times back again.&#8221;</p>
<p>But notwithstanding her hope and a country&#8217;s
wish, the good old times were not at hand.</p>
<p>Pussy reached home and told the story. Baby
went down plump into the wooden cradle at the
first note of it, and set up a tune of rejoicing in
his own fashion which no one regarded. Brother
Benjamin, aged thirteen, whistled furiously, regardless
of the honors of the day. Sammy, who
was ten, clapped his hands and knocked his heels
together, first in joy, and then began to fear lest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
the war should be over before he grew big
enough to be in it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; said Pussy, a few minutes later, &#8220;let
Benny come with me to tell Mr. Gale about it;
may he?&#8221;</p>
<p>Pussy laid aside her Sunday bonnet, tied a
straw hat over her ears with a silk kerchief to
keep out the wind, and in three minutes got
Benny into the highway.</p>
<p>&#8220;See here, Ben, I&#8217;m going to light a fire on
Baldhead to tell all the folks together about it,
and I want you to help me; quick, before it gets
dark.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t gather fagots,&#8221; responded Ben.</p>
<p>Yes, she could, and would, and did, while
Benny went to the house nearest to Baldhead to
ask for some fire in a kettle.</p>
<p>The two worked with such vigor and will that
the first gathering of darkness saw the light of
the beacon-flame burst forth, and the great March
wind blew it into fiercest glow. Every eye that
saw the fire there knew that it had been kindled
with a purpose, and many feet from house and
hamlet set forth to learn the cause.</p>
<p>While Pussy and Ben were yet adding fagots
to the fire, they heard a voice crying out: &#8220;The
young rascals shall be punished soundly for this,&#8221;
and ere Pussy had time to explain or expostulate,
a strong man had Ben in his grasp.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop that, sir!&#8221; cried the girl, rushing to the
rescue with a burning fagot that she had seized
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
from the fire, and shaking it full in the assailant&#8217;s
face.</p>
<p>By the light of it, the man saw Pussy and she
saw him; and then both began to laugh, while
Ben rubbed his ears and wondered whether they
were both on his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;It means,&#8221; spoke the girl, waving the still
flaming brand toward the east, &#8220;that the British
left Boston this morning, and that General&#8221;&mdash;(just
here a dozen men were at the fire. Pussy
raised her voice and continued)&mdash;&#8220;Washington
wants you all, every one of you, to march straight
to Governor Trumbull, and he&#8217;ll tell you what to
do next.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If that&#8217;s the case,&#8221; said the responsible man
of the constantly-increasing group after questioning
Pussy, &#8220;we&#8217;d better summon the militia by
the ringing of the bell,&#8221; and off they went in the
direction of the village, while Pussy and Ben
went home.</p>
<p>The next day saw fifty men, well armed, and
provisioned for three days, on the road to Lebanon.
They marched into town and into the
now famous war-office of Governor Trumbull, to
his pleased surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who sent you?&#8221; asked the governor, for it
was not yet six hours since the demand on the
nearest town had been made.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who sent us?&#8221; echoed the lieutenant, looking
confused and at a loss to explain, and finally
answering truthfully, he said: &#8220;It was a young
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
girl, your excellency. She lit a beacon fire on
a hill and gave the command that we report to
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>A laugh ran around the sides of the old war-office.
The messenger who had ridden from
Cambridge sat upon the counter pressing his
spurs into the wood and heard it all.</p>
<p>&#8220;And who commissioned the girl as a recruiting
officer?&#8221; questioned the governor.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid,&#8221; said the messenger, &#8220;I am the
guilty party. I met a young patriot in scarlet
cloak who asked my news, and, I told her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is the girl&#8217;s father?&#8221; demanded
Governor Trumbull.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is with the army, at Cambridge,&#8221; was
the response.</p>
<p>&#8220;And his name?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Reuben Dean.&#8221;</p>
<p>A scratch or two of the quill pen was heard on
the open paper. It was folded, sealed, and
handed to the ready horseman, with the words:
&#8220;Reuben Dean; he is mentioned for promotion.&#8221;</p>
<p>The words, as they were spoken by Governor
Trumbull, were caught up and gathered into a
mighty cheer, for every man of their number
knew that Reuben Dean was worthy of promotion,
even had his daughter not gained it for him
by her services as recruiting officer.</p>

<h2>DAVID BUSHNELL AND HIS AMERICAN TURTLE.
<span class='chsub'> <br /><br />THE FIRST SUBMARINE BOAT INVENTED.</span></h2>
</div>
<p>&#8220;David!&#8221; cried a voice stern and commanding,
from a house-door one
morning, as the young man who
owned the name was taking a short
cut &#8220;across lots&#8221; in the direction of Pautapoug.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sir!&#8221; cried the youth in response to the call,
and pausing as nearly as he could, and at the
same time keep his feet from sinking into the
marshy soil.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are you going?&#8221; was the response.</p>
<p>&#8220;To Pautapoug, to see Uriah Hayden, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better hire out at ship-building with
him. Your college learning&#8217;s of no earthly use
in these days,&#8221; said the father of David Bushnell,
returning from the door, and sinking slowly down
into his high-backed chair.</p>
<p>Then spoke up a sweet-voiced woman from the
kitchen fire-side, where she had that moment been
hanging an iron pot on the crane:</p>
<p>&#8220;Have a little patience, father (Mrs. Bushnell
always called her husband, father), David is only
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
looking about to see what to do. It&#8217;s hardly
four weeks since he was graduated.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;True enough; but where can you find an idle
man in all Saybrook town? and you know as
well as I do that it makes men despise college-learning
to see folks idle. I&#8217;d rather, for my
part, David <i>did</i> go to work on the ship Uriah
Hayden is building. I wish I knew what he&#8217;s
gone over there for to-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>A funny smile crept into the curves of Mrs.
Bushnell&#8217;s lips, but her husband did not notice it.</p>
<p>Mr. Bushnell moved uneasily in his chair, as he
sat leaning forward, both hands clasped about a
hickory stick, and his chin resting on the knob at
its top. Presently he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Anna, I fear David is getting into bad habits.
He used to talk a good deal. Now he sits with
his eyes on the floor, and his forehead in wrinkles,
and I&#8217;m <i>sure</i> I&#8217;ve heard him moving about more
than one night lately, after all honest folks were
in bed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Father, you must remember that you&#8217;ve been
very sick, and fever gives one queer notions
sometimes. I shouldn&#8217;t wonder one bit if you
dreamed you heard something, when &#8217;twas only
the rats behind the wainscot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rats don&#8217;t step like a grown man in his
stocking-feet, nor make the rafters creak, either.&#8221;</p>
<p>Madam Bushnell appeared to be investigating
the contents of the pot hanging on the crane, and
perhaps the heat of the blazing wood was sufficient
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
to account for the burning of her cheeks.
She cooled them a moment later by going down
cellar after cider, a mug of which she offered to
her husband, proposing the while that he should
have his chair out of doors, and sit under the
sycamore tree by the river-bank. When he
assented, and she had seen him safely in the chair,
she made haste to David&#8217;s bed-room.</p>
<p>Since Mr. Bushnell&#8217;s illness began, no one had
ascended to the chamber except herself and her
son.</p>
<p>On two shelves hanging against the wall were
the books that he had brought home with him
from Yale College, just four weeks ago.</p>
<p>A table was drawn near to the one window in
the room. On it were bits of wood, with iron
scraps, fragments of glass and copper. In fact,
the same thing to-day would suggest boat-building
to the mother of any lad finding them among her
boy&#8217;s playthings. To this mother they suggested
nothing beyond the fact that David was engaged
in something which he wished to keep a profound
secret.</p>
<p>He had not told her so. It had not been
necessary. She had divined it and kept silence,
having all a mother&#8217;s confidence in, and hope of,
her son&#8217;s success in life.</p>
<p>As she surveyed the place, she thought:</p>
<p>&#8220;There is nothing here, even if he (meaning
her husband) should take it into his head to come
up and look about.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span></div>
<p>Meanwhile young David had crossed the
Pochaug River, and was half the way to
Pautapoug.</p>
<p>All this happened more than a thousand moons
ago, when all the land was aroused and astir, and
David Bushnell was not in the least surprised to
meet, at the ship-yard of Uriah Hayden, Jonathan
Trumbull, Governor of Connecticut.</p>
<p>This man was everywhere, seeing to everything,
in that year. Whatever his country needed, or
Commander-in-chief Washington ordered from
the camp at Cambridge, was forthcoming.</p>
<p>A ship had been demanded of Connecticut, and
so Governor Trumbull had come down from
Lebanon to look with his own eyes at the huge
ribs of oak, thereafter to sail the seas as &#8220;The
Oliver Cromwell.&#8221;</p>
<p>The self-same oaken ribs had intense interest
for young David Bushnell. Uriah Hayden had
promised to sell to him all the pieces of ship-timber
that should be left, and while the governor and
the builder planned, he went about gathering
together fragments.</p>
<p>&#8220;Better take enough to build a boat that will
carry a seine. &#8217;T won&#8217;t cost you a mite more, and
might serve you a good turn to have a sizable
craft in a heavy sea some day,&#8221; said Mr. Hayden.</p>
<p>Now David Bushnell had been wishing that he
had some good and sufficient reason to give Mr.
Hayden for wanting the stuff at all, and here he
had given it to him.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span></div>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true,&#8221; spoke up David, &#8220;but how am I
to get all this over to Pochaug?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t get it over at all, until it&#8217;s ready to row
down the Connecticut, and around the Sound.
You&#8217;re welcome to build your boat at the yard,
and, now and then, there will be odd minutes that
the men can help you on with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>David thanked Mr. Hayden, grew cheerful of
heart over the prospect of owning a boat of his
own, and went merrily back to the village of
Pochaug.</p>
<p>Two weeks later David&#8217;s boat was ready for
sea. It was launched into the Connecticut from
the ways on which the &#8220;Oliver Cromwell&#8221;
grew, was named Lady Fenwick, and, when
water-tight, was rowed down the river, past Saybrook
and Tomb Hill, and so into the Long
Island Sound.</p>
<p>When its owner and navigator went by Tomb
Hill, he removed his hat, and bowed reverently.
He thought with respect and admiration of the
occupant of the sandstone tomb on its height, the
Lady Fenwick who had slept there one hundred
and thirty years.</p>
<p>With blistered palms and burning fingers David
Bushnell pushed his boat with pride up the
Pochaug River, and tied it to a stake at the
bridge just beyond the sycamore tree, near his
father&#8217;s door.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll fetch father and mother out to see it,&#8221; he
thought, &#8220;when the moon gets up a little higher.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span></div>
<p>With boyish pride he looked down at the work
of his hands from the river-bank, and went in to
get his supper.</p>
<p>&#8220;David!&#8221; called Mr. Bushnell, having heard
his steps in the entry-way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here I am, father,&#8221; returned the young man,
appearing within the room, and speaking in a
cheerful tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think you have wasted about time
enough?&#8221;</p>
<p>The voice was high-wrought and nervous in
the extreme. He, poor man, had been that afternoon
thinking the matter over in a convalescent&#8217;s
weak manner of looking upon the act of another
man.</p>
<p>David Bushnell, smiling still, and taking out a
large silver watch from his waistcoat pocket, and
looking at it, replied:</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t wasted one moment, father. The
tide was against me, but I&#8217;ve rowed around from
Pautapoug ship-yard to the sycamore tree out
here since two o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>You</i> row a boat!&#8221; cried Mr. Bushnell, with
lofty disdain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, father, you have not a very good opinion
of your son, have you?&#8221; questioned the son.
&#8220;Come, though, and see what he has been doing.
Come, mother,&#8221; as Mrs. Bushnell entered, bearing
David&#8217;s supper in her hands.</p>
<p>She put it down. Mr. Bushnell pulled himself
upright with a groan or two, and suffered David
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
to assist him by the support of his arm as they
went out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, you tremble as though you had the
palsy,&#8221; said the father.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nothing. I&#8217;m not used to pulling so long
at the oar,&#8221; said the son.</p>
<p>When they came to the bank, the full moon
shone athwart the little boat rocking on the
stream.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; exclaimed both parents.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is the Lady Fenwick. I&#8217;ve been building
the boat myself. You advised me, father, to
go to ship-building one morning&mdash;do you remember?
I took your advice, and began at the bottom
of the ladder.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>You</i> built that boat with your own hands, you
say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With my own hands, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In two weeks&#8217; time?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And rowed it all the way down the river, and
up the Pochaug?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good boy! You may go in and have your
supper,&#8221; said Mr. Bushnell, patting him on the
back, just as he had done when he returned from
college with his first award.</p>
<p>As for Madam Bushnell, she smiled down upon
Lady Fenwick and did her great reverence in her
heart, while she said to the boat-builder:</p>
<p>&#8220;David, dear, wait a few minutes, and I&#8217;ll give
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
you something nice and warm for your supper.
Your father, Ezra and I had ours long ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>That night Mr. Bushnell did not lie awake to
listen for the stealthy stepping in the upper room.
He slept all the sounder, because he had at last
seen one stroke of honest work, as he called it, as
the result of his endeavors to help David on in
life.</p>
<p>As for David himself, he went to sleep, saying
in his heart: &#8220;It is a good stepping-stone at
least;&#8221; which conclusion grew into form in sleep,
and shaped itself into a mighty monster, that
bored itself under mountains, and, after taking a
nap, roused and shook itself so mightily that the
mountain flew into fragments high in air.</p>
<p>If you go, to-day, into the Connecticut River
from Long Island Sound, you will see on its left
bank the old town of Saybrook, on its right the
slightly younger town of Lyme, and you will
have passed by, without having been very much
interested in it, an island lying just within the
shelter of either bank.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1774 a band of fishermen put
up a reel upon the island, on which to wind their
seine. Over the reel they built a roof to protect
it from the rains. With the exception of the reel,
there was no building upon the island. A large
portion of the land was submerged at the highest
tides, and in the spring freshets, and was covered
with a generous growth of salt grass, in which a
small army might readily find concealment.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span></div>
<p>The little fishing band was now sadly broken
and lessened by one of the Washingtonian demands
upon Brother Jonathan. For reasons that
he did not choose to give, David Bushnell joined
this band of fishermen in the summer of 1775.
Gradually he made himself, by purchase, the
owner of the larger part of the reel and seine.
In a few weeks&#8217; time he had induced his brother
Ezra to become as much of a fisherman as he
himself was.</p>
<p>As the days went by, the brothers fairly haunted
this island. They gave it a name for their own
use, and, early in the day-dawn of many a morning,
they pulled the Lady Fenwick wearily up
the Pochaug, to snatch a few winks of sleep at
home, before the sun should fairly rise and call
them to their daily tasks, for David assumed to
help Ezra on the farm, even as Ezra helped him
on the island.</p>
<p>The two brothers owned the reel and the seine
before the end of the month of August in 1775.
As soon as they became the sole owners, they
procured lumber and enclosed the reel, and very
seldom took down the seine from its great round
perch; they used it just often enough to allay
any suspicion as to their real object in becoming
owners of the fishing implements.</p>
<p>About that time a story grew into general belief
that the tomb of Lady Fenwick was haunted.
Boatmen, passing in the stillness of the solemn
night hours, asserted that they heard strange
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
noises issuing from the hill, just where the lady
slept in her lonely burial-place. The sounds
seemed to emerge from the earth, and timid men
passed up the river with every inch of sail set to
catch the breeze, lest the solemn thud should
sound, that a hundred persons were willing to testify
had been heard by each and every one of them,
at some hour of the night, coming from the tomb.</p>
<p>One evening in late September, the two
brothers started forth as usual, nominally to &#8220;go
fishing.&#8221; As they stepped down the bank, Mr.
Bushnell followed them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Boys,&#8221; said he, &#8220;it&#8217;s an uncommon fine night
on the water. I believe I&#8217;ll take a seat in your
boat, with your permission. I used to like fishing
myself when I was young and spry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And leave mother alone!&#8221; objected David.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s been out with me many a night on the
Sound. She&#8217;s brave, and won&#8217;t mind a good
south-west wind, such as I dare say breaks in on
the shore this minute. Go and call her.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so the family started forth to go fishing.</p>
<p>This was a night the two brothers had been
looking forward to during weeks of earnest labor,
and now&mdash;well, it could not be helped, and there
was not a moment in which to hold counsel.</p>
<p>Mr. Bushnell had planned this surprise early in
the day, but had not told his wife until evening.
Then he announced his determination to &#8220;learn
what all these midnight and all-night absences
did mean.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span></div>
<p>As the Lady Fenwick came out from the
Pochaug River into the Sound, the south-west
wind brought crested waves to shore. The wind
was increasing, and, to the great relief of David
and Ezra, Mr. Bushnell gave the order to turn
back into the river.</p>
<p>The next day David Bushnell asked his mother
whether or not she knew the reason his father
had proposed to go out with them the night
before.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, David,&#8221; was the reply, &#8220;I do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you tell me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He does not believe that you and Ezra go
fishing at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you believe about it, mother?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe in <i>you</i>, David, and that when you
have anything to tell to me, I shall be glad to
listen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And father does not trust me yet; I am sorry,&#8221;
said David, turning away. And then, as by a
sudden impulse, he returned and said:</p>
<p>&#8220;If you can trust <i>me</i> so entirely, mother, <i>we</i> can
trust <i>you</i>. To-day, two gentlemen will be here.
You will please be ready to go out in the boat
with us whenever they come.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where to?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To my fishing ground, mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>The strangers arrived, and were presented to
Mrs. Bushnell as Dr. Gale and his friend, Mr.
Franklin.</p>
<p>At three of the clock the little family set off in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
the row-boat. Down at Pochaug harbor, there
was Mr. Bushnell hallooing to them to be taken
on board.</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw my family starting on an unknown
voyage,&#8221; he remarked, as the boat approached
the shore as nearly as it could, while he waded
out to meet it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, Friend Gale, is that you?&#8221; he said, as
with dripping feet he stepped in. &#8220;And whither
bound?&#8221; he added, dropping into a seat.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the far and distant land of the unknown,
Mr. Bushnell. Permit me to introduce you to
my friend, Mr. Franklin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Franklin! Franklin!&#8221; exclaimed Mr. Bushnell,
eyeing the stranger a little rudely. &#8220;<i>Doctor
Benjamin Franklin</i>, <i>if you please</i>, Benjamin Gale!&#8221;
he corrected, to the utter amazement of the
party.</p>
<p>The oars missed the stroke, caught it again,
and, for a minute, poor Dr. Franklin was confused
by the sudden announcement that he existed at
all, and, in particular, in that small boat on the
sea.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, even so,&#8221; responded Dr. Gale, cheerfully
adding, &#8220;and we&#8217;re going down to see the
new fishing tackle your son is going to catch the
enemy&#8217;s ships with.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fishing tackle! Enemy&#8217;s ships! Why, David
<i>is</i> the laziest man in all Saybrook town. He does
nothing with his first summer but fish, fish all
night long! The only stroke of honest work I&#8217;ve
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
<i>ever</i> known him to do was to build this boat we&#8217;re
in.&#8221;</p>
<p>During this time the brothers were pulling with
a will for the island.</p>
<p>Arrived there, the boat was drawn up on the
sand, the seine-house unlocked, and, when the
light of day had been let into it, fishing-reel and
seine had disappeared, and, in the language of
Doctor Benjamin Gale, this is what they found
therein:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3><span class='smcap'>The American Turtle.</span></h3>
<p>&#8220;The body, when standing upright, in the position in which it
is navigated, has the nearest resemblance to the two upper shells
of the tortoise, joined together. It is seven and a half feet long,
and six feet high. The person who navigates it enters at the
top. It has a brass top or cover which receives the person&#8217;s
head, as he sits on a seat, and is fastened on the inside by
screws.</p>
<p>&#8220;On this brass head are fixed eight glasses, viz: two before, two
on each side, one behind, and one to look out upwards. On the
same brass head are fixed two brass tubes to admit fresh air when
requisite, and a ventilator at the side, to free the machine from
the air rendered unfit for respiration.</p>
<p>&#8220;On the inside is fixed a barometer, by which he can tell the
depth he is under water; a compass by which he knows the
course he steers. In the barometer, and on the needles of the
compass, is fixed fox-fire&mdash;that is, wood that gives light in the
dark. His ballast consists of about nine hundred-weight of lead,
which he carries at the bottom and on the outside of the machine,
part of which is so fixed as he can let run down to the bottom,
and serves as an anchor by which he can ride <i>ad libitum</i>.</p>
<p>&#8220;He has a sounding lead fixed at the bow, by which he can take
the depth of water under him, and a forcing-pump by which he
can free the machine at pleasure, and can rise above water, and
again immerge, as occasion requires.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span></div>
<p>&#8220;In the bow he has a pair of oars fixed like the two opposite
arms of a windmill, with which he can row forward, and, turning
them the opposite way, row the machine backward; another pair,
fixed upon the same model, with which he can row the machine
round, either to the right or left; and a third by which he can row
the machine either up or down; all of which are turned by foot,
like a spinning wheel. The rudder by which he steers he manages
by hand, within-board.</p>
<p>&#8220;All these shafts which pass through the machine are so curiously
fixed as not to admit any water.</p>
<p>&#8220;The magazine for the powder is carried on the hinder part of
the machine, without-board, and so contrived that, when he comes
under the side of a ship, he rubs down the side until he comes to
the keel, and a hook so fixed as that when it touches the keel it
raises a spring which frees the magazine from the machine, and
fastens it to the side of the ship; at the same time it draws a pin,
which sets the watch-work a-going, which, at a given time,
springs the lock, and an explosion ensues.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus wrote Dr. Benjamin Gale to Silas Deane,
member of Congress at Philadelphia. His letter
bears the date November 9, 1775, and, after
describing the wonderful machine, he adds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;I well know the man. Lately he has conducted matters with
the greatest secrecy, both for the personal safety of the navigator,
and to produce the greater astonishment to those against whom
it is designed; and, you may call me a visionary, an enthusiast,
or what you please, I do insist upon it that I believe the inspiration
of the Almighty has given him understanding for this very
purpose and design.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the seine-house door had been fastened
open, when Dr. Franklin and Dr. Gale had gone
within, followed by the two brothers, Mr. Bushnell
and his wife stood without looking in, and
wondering in their hearts what the sight they
saw could mean; for, of the intent or purpose of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
the curious, oaken, iron-bound, many-paddled,
brass-headed, window-lighted thing, they, it must
be remembered, knew nothing. It must mean
something extraordinary, of course, or Doctor
Franklin would never have thought it worth his
while to come out of his way to behold it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Father,&#8221; whispered Mrs. Bushnell, &#8220;it&#8217;s the
<i>fish</i> David has been all summer catching.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fish!&#8221; ejaculated Mr. Bushnell, &#8220;it&#8217;s more
like a turtle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good!&#8221; spoke up Dr. Gale, from within.
&#8220;Turtle it shall be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is the first <i>submarine</i> boat ever made&mdash;a
grand idea, wrought into substance,&#8221; slowly pronounced
Dr. Franklin; &#8220;let us have it forth into
the river.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And run the risk of discovery?&#8221; suggested
David, pleased that his work approved itself to
the man of science.</p>
<p>&#8220;We meant to try it last night, but failed,&#8221; said
Ezra Bushnell.</p>
<p>&#8220;There, now, father, don&#8217;t you wish we had
staid at home?&#8221; whispered Mrs. Bushnell.</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; growled the father. &#8220;They would
have killed themselves getting it down alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stepped within and laid his hand on the
machine, saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;Anna, you keep watch, and, if any boat heaves
in sight, let us know. Does the Turtle snap,
David?&#8221; he questioned, putting forth his hand
and laying it cautiously upon the animal.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Never, until the word is given,&#8221; replied the
son, and then ten strong hands applied the
strength within them to lift the curious piece of
mechanism and carry it without.</p>
<p>The seine-house was close to the river-bank,
and in a half-hour&#8217;s time the American Turtle
was in its native element.</p>
<p>Madam Anna Bushnell kept strict watch over
the shores and the river, but not a sail slid into
sight, not an oar troubled the waters of the tide,
as it tossed back the tumble of the down-flowing
river.</p>
<p>It was a hard duty for the mother to perform;
for, at a glance toward the bank, she saw David
step into the machine, and the brass cover close
down over his head. She felt suffocating fears
for him, as, at last, the thing began to move into
the stream. She saw it go out, she saw it slowly
sinking, going down out of sight, until even the
brass head was submerged.</p>
<p>Then she forsook her post, and hastened to the
bank to keep watch with the rest.</p>
<p>One, two, three minutes went by. The men
looked at the surface of the waters, at each other,
grew thoughtful, pale; the mother gasped and
dropped on the salt grass, fainting; the brother
gave to Lady Fenwick a running push, bounded
on board, and clutched the oars to row swiftly to
the spot where David went down.</p>
<p>Mr. Bushnell filled his hat with water, and
sprinkled the pale face in the sedge.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span></div>
<p>&#8220;<i>There! there!</i>&#8221; cried Dr. Franklin, with distended
eyes and eager outlook.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Where? where?</i>&#8221; ejaculated Dr. Gale, striving
to take into vision the whole surface of the river,
at a glance.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right! He&#8217;s coming up <i>plump</i>!&#8221;
shouted Ezra, from his boat, as he rowed with
speed for the spot where a brass tube was rising,
sun-burnished, from the Connecticut.</p>
<p>Presently the brass head, with its very small
windows, emerged, even the oaken sides were
rising,&mdash;and Mr. Bushnell was greeting the returning
consciousness of his wife with the words:</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right, mother. David is safe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let him know,&#8221; were the first words she
spoke, &#8220;that his own mother was so faithless as
to doubt!&#8221;</p>
<p>And now, paddle, paddle, toward the river-bank
came the Turtle, David Bushnell&#8217;s head rising
out of its shell, proud confidence shining forth
from his eyes, as feet and hands busied themselves
in navigating the boat that had lived for months
in his brain, and now was living, in very substance,
under his control.</p>
<p>As he neared the bank a shout of acclamation
greeted him.</p>
<p>He reached the island, was fairly dragged forth
from his seat, and carried up to the spot where
his mother sat, trying to overcome every trace of
past doubt and fear.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Dr. Gale, &#8220;let us give thanks unto
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
Him who hath given this youth understanding to
do this great work.&#8221;</p>
<p>With bared heads and devout hearts the thanksgiving
went upward, and thereafter a perfect
shower of questions pelted David Bushnell concerning
his device to blow up ships: <i>how</i> he came
to think of it at all&mdash;<i>where</i> he got this idea and
that as to its construction&mdash;to all of which he
simply said:</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>You&#8217;ll find your answer in the prayer you&#8217;ve just
offered!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said practical Mr. Bushnell, &#8220;the Lord
did not send you money to buy oak and iron and
brass, did he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; returned David, &#8220;by the hand of my
good friend, Dr. Gale. To him belongs half the
victory.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pshaw! pshaw!&#8221; impatiently uttered the
doctor. &#8220;I tell you it is <i>no such thing</i>! I only
advanced My Lady here,&#8221; turning to Madam
Bushnell, &#8220;a little money, on her promise to pay
me at some future time. I&#8217;m mightily ashamed
<i>now</i> that I took the promise at all. Madam Bushnell,
I&#8217;ll never take a penny of it back again, <i>never</i>,
as long as I live. I <i>will</i> have a little of the credit
of this achievement, and no one shall hinder me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How is that, mother?&#8221; questioned Mr. Bushnell.
&#8220;<i>You</i> borrow money and not tell me!&#8221; and
David and Ezra looked at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I&mdash;&#8221; stammered forth the woman, &#8220;I only
<i>guessed</i> that David was doing something that he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
wanted money for, and told Dr. Gale if he gave
it to him I would repay it. Do you <i>care</i>, father?&#8221;</p>
<p>Before he had a chance to get an answer in,
David Bushnell stepped forward, and, taking the
little figure of his mother in his arms, kissed her
sharply, and walked away, to give some imaginary
attention to the Turtle at the bank.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a fair land to work for!&#8221; spoke up Doctor
Franklin, looking about upon river and earth and
sea; &#8220;worthy it is of our highest efforts; of our
lives, even, if need be. God give us strength as
our need <i>shall</i> be.&#8221;</p>
<p>With many a tug and pull and hearty heave-ho,
the Turtle was hoisted up the bank and safely
drawn into the seine-house. The door was locked,
and Lady Fenwick&#8217;s tomb gave forth no sound
that night.</p>
<p>Doctor Franklin went his way to Boston. Doctor
Gale returned to Killingworth and his waiting
patients, and the Bushnells, father, mother and
sons, having put the two gentlemen on the Saybrook
shore, went down the river into the
Sound, along its edge, and up the small Pochaug
to their own home by the sycamore tree.</p>
<p>Mr. Bushnell and Ezra did the rowing that
night. David&#8217;s white hands had, somehow, a
new radiance in them for his father&#8217;s eyes, and
did not seem exactly fitted for rowing just a common
boat and every-day oars.</p>
<p>The young man sat in the stern, beside his
mother, one arm around her waist, and the other
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
clasped closely between her little palms, while,
now and then, her finding eyes would penetrate
his consciousness with a glance that seemed to
say, &#8220;I always believed in you, David.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>If you go to-day and stand upon the site of the
old fort, built at the mouth of the Connecticut
River, in the year 1635, by Lion Gardiner, once
engineer in the service of the Prince of Orange,
and search the waters up and down for the island
on which David Bushnell built the American
Turtle in 1775, you will not find it.</p>
<p>If you seek the oldest inhabitant of Saybrook,
and ask him to point out its locality, he will say,
with boyhood&#8217;s fondness for olden play-grounds
in his tone:</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, yes! It is <i>Poverty</i> Island that you mean.
It used to be there, but spring freshets and beating
storms have washed it away.&#8221;</p>
<p>The unexpected visit of Dr. Benjamin Franklin,
to see the machine David Bushnell was building,
gave new force to that young gentleman&#8217;s confidence
in his own powers of invention.</p>
<p>He worked with increased energy and hope to
perfect boat and magazine, that he might do good
service with them before winter should fall on
the waters of the Massachusetts Bay, where the
hostile ships were lying.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span></div>
<p>At last came the day wherein the final trial-trip
should be made. The pumps built by Mr. Doolittle,
but not according to order, had failed once,
but new ones had been supplied, and everything
seemed propitious. David and Ezra, with their
mother in the boat, rowed once more to Poverty
Island. &#8220;On the morrow the great venture
should begin,&#8221; they said.</p>
<p>The time was mid-October. The forests had
wrapped the cooling coast in warmth of coloring
that was soft and many-hued as the shawls of
Cashmere, while the sun-made fringe of goldenrod
fell along the shores of river and island and
sea.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bushnell&#8217;s heart beat proudly above the
fond affection that could not suppress a shiver, as
the Turtle was pushed into the stream. She
could not help seeing that David made a line fast
from the seine-house to his boat ere he went
down. They watched many minutes to see him
rise to the surface, but he did not.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; said Ezra, &#8220;the pump for forcing
water out when he wants to rise don&#8217;t work, and
we must pull him in. He feared it.&#8221;</p>
<p>As he spoke the words he laid hold on the line,
and began gently to draw on it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurry! hurry! <i>do!</i>&#8221; cried Mrs. Bushnell,
seizing the same line close to the water&#8217;s edge,
and drawing on it with all her strength. She
was vexed that Ezra had not told her the danger
in the beginning, and she &#8220;knew <i>very</i> well that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
<span class='smcaplc'>SHE</span> would not have stood there and let David
die of suffocation, in that horrid, brass-topped
coffin!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold, mother!&#8221; cried Ezra; &#8220;pull gently, or
the line may part on some barnacled rock if it
gets caught.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Mrs. Bushnell pulled in as fast as
she could.</p>
<p>The tide was sweeping up the river, and a
shark, in hard chase after a school of menhaden,
swam steadily up, with fin out of water.</p>
<p>Just as the shark reached the place, he made a
dive, and the rope parted!</p>
<p>Mrs. Bushnell screamed a word or two of the
terror that had seized her. Ezra looked up,
amazed to find the rope coming in so readily,
hand over hand. He cast it down, sprang to the
boat, and pushed off to the possible rescue, only
to find that the Turtle was making for the river-bank
instead of the island.</p>
<p>He rowed to the spot. His brother, for the
first time in his life, was overcome with disappointment
and disinclined to talk.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I,&#8221; said David, wiping his forehead. &#8220;I
grew tired, and made for shore. The tide was
taking me up fast.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you let go the line?&#8221; questioned Ezra.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The pump works all right, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve frightened mother terribly.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Have I? I never thought. I <i>forgot</i> she was
here. Let us get back, then;&#8221; and the two
brothers, without speaking a word, rowed down
against the sweep of tide, the great Turtle in tow.</p>
<p>The three went home, still keeping a silence
broken only by briefest possible question and
answer.</p>
<p>The golden October night fell upon the old
town. Pochaug River, its lone line of silver
gathered in many a stretch of interval into which
the moon looked calmly down, lay on the land
for many a mile.</p>
<p>Again and again, during the evening, David
Bushnell went out from the house and stood
silently on the rough bridge that crossed the
river by the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let David alone, mother,&#8221; urged Ezra, as she
was about to follow him on one occasion. &#8220;He
is thinking out something, and is better alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>That which the young man was thinking at the
moment was, that he wished the moon would
hurry and go down. He longed for darkness.</p>
<p>The night was growing cold. Frost was in the air.</p>
<p>As he stood on the rough logs, a post-rider,
hurrying by with letters, came up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Holloa there!&#8221; he called aloud, not liking the
looks of the man on the bridge.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s I,&mdash;David Bushnell, Joe Downs! You can
ride by in safety,&#8221; he responded, ringing out one
of his merriest chimes of laughter at the very
idea of being taken for a highwayman.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve news,&#8221; said Joe; &#8220;want it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Joe Downs opened his pocket, and, by the light
of the moon, found the letter he had referred to.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dr. Gale told me not to fail to put this into
your hands as I came by. I should kind o&#8217; judge,
by the way he <i>spoke</i>, that the continent couldn&#8217;t
get along very well <i>&#8217;thout you</i>, if I hadn&#8217;t known
a thing or two. Howsomever, here&#8217;s the letter,
and I&#8217;ve to jog on to Guilford afore the moon
goes down. So good-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good night, Joe. Thank you for stopping,&#8221;
said David, going into the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;Were you expecting that letter, David?&#8221;
questioned Mr. Bushnell, when it had been read.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir. It is from Dr. Gale. He asks me to
hasten matters as far as possible, but a new contrivance
will have to go in before I am ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There! <i>That&#8217;s</i> what troubles him,&#8221; thought
both Mrs. Bushnell and Ezra, and they exchanged
glances of sympathy and satisfaction&mdash;and the
little household went to sleep, quite care-free
that night.</p>
<p>At two of the clock, with nearly noiseless
tread, David Bushnell left the house.</p>
<p>As the door closed his mother moved uneasily
in her sleep, and awoke with the sudden consciousness
that something uncanny had happened.
She looked from a window and saw, by the
light of a low-lying moon, that David had gone
out.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span></div>
<p>Without awakening her husband she protected
herself with needful clothing, and, wrapped about
in one of the curious plaid blankets of mingled
blue and white, adorned with white fringe, that
are yet to be found in the land, she followed into
the night.</p>
<p>Save for the sleepy tinkle of the water over the
stones in the Pochaug River, and an occasional
cry of a night-bird still lingering by the sea, the
air was very still.</p>
<p>With light tread across the bridge she ran a
little way, and then ventured a timid cry of her
own into the night:</p>
<p>&#8220;David! David!&#8221;</p>
<p>Now David Bushnell hoped to escape without
awakening his mother. He was lingering near,
to learn whether his going had disturbed anyone,
and he was quite prepared for the call.</p>
<p>Turning back to meet her he thought: &#8220;<i>What</i>
a mother <i>mine</i> is.&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Well, mother,
what is it? I was afraid I might disturb you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O David!&#8221; was all that she could utter in
response.</p>
<p>&#8220;And so <i>you</i> are troubled about me, are you?
I&#8217;m only going to chase the will-o&#8217;-the-wisp a
little while, and I could not do it, you know,
until moon-down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>O</i> David!&#8221; and this time with emphatic pressure
on his arm, &#8220;David, come home. <i>I</i> can&#8217;t
let you go off alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come with me, then. You&#8217;re well blanketed,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
I see. I&#8217;d much rather have some one with me,
only Ezra was tired and sleepy.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said this with so much of his accustomed
manner that Mrs. Bushnell put her hand within
his arm and went on, quite content now, and willing
that he should speak when it pleased him to
do so, and it pleased him very soon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Little mother,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I am afraid you are
losing faith in me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never! David; only&mdash;I <i>was</i> a little afraid that
you were losing your own head, or faith in yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; but I <i>am</i> afraid I&#8217;ve lost my faith in
something else. I showed you the two bits of
fox-fire that were crossed on one end of the
needle in the compass, and the one bit made fast
to the other? Well, to-day, when I went to the
bottom of the river, the fox-fire gave no light, and
the compass was useless. Can you understand
how bad that would be under an enemy&#8217;s ship,
not to know in which direction to navigate?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You must have fresh fire, then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>That</i> is just what I am out for to-night. I
had to wait till the moon was gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! is <i>that</i> all? How foolish I have been!
but you ought to tell me some things, sometimes,
David.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And so I will. I tell you now that it will be
well for you to go home and go to sleep. I may
have to go deep into the woods to find the fire I
want.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span></div>
<p>But his mother only walked by his side a little
faster than before, and on they went to a place
where a bit of woodland had grown up above
fallen trees.</p>
<p>They searched in places wherein both had seen
the fire of decaying wood a hundred times, but
not one gleam of phosphorescence could be found
anywhere. At last they turned to go homeward.</p>
<p>&#8220;What will you do, David? Go and search in
the Killingworth woods to-morrow night?&#8221; she
asked, as they drew near home.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is of no use,&#8221; he said, with a sigh. &#8220;It
<i>must</i> be that the frost destroys the fox-fire. Unless
Dr. Franklin knows of a light that will not
eat up the air, everything must be put off until
spring.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next day David Bushnell went to Killingworth,
to tell the story to Dr. Gale, and Dr. Gale
wrote to Silas Deane (Conn. Historical Col., Vol.
2), begging him to inquire of Dr. Franklin concerning
the possibility of using the Philosopher&#8217;s
Lantern, but no light was found, and the poor
Turtle was housed in the seine-house on Poverty
Island during the long winter, which proved to
be one of great mildness from late December to
mid-February.</p>
<p>In February we find David Bushnell before
Governor Jonathan Trumbull and his Council at
Lebanon, to tell about and illustrate the marvels
of his wonderful machine.</p>
<p>During this time the whole affair had been kept
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
a profound secret from all but the faithful few
surrounding the inventor. And now, if ever, the
time was drawing near wherein the labor and
outlay must either repay laborer and lender, or
give to both great trouble and distress.</p>
<p>I cannot tell you with what trepidation the
young man walked into the War Office at Lebanon,
with a very small Turtle under his arm.</p>
<p>You will please remember the situation of the
colonists at that moment. On the land they
feared not to contend with Englishmen. Love of
liberty in the Provincials was strong enough,
when united with a trusty musket and a fair
supply of powder, to encounter red-coated regulars
of the British army; but on the ocean, and
in every bay, harbor and river, they were powerless.
The enemy&#8217;s ships had kept Boston in
siege for nearly two years, the Americans having
no opposing force to contend with them.</p>
<p>Could this little Turtle, which David Bushnell
carried under his arm, do the work he wished it
to, why, every ship of the line could be blown
into the air!</p>
<p>The inventor had faith in his invention, but he
feared, when he looked into the faces of the
grave Governor and his Council of War, that he
could <i>never</i> impart his own belief to them.</p>
<p>I cannot tell you with what trust of heart and
faith of soul Mrs. Bushnell kept the February
day in the house by the bridge at Pochaug.
Even the strong-minded, sturdy-nerved Mr. Bushnell
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
looked often up the road by which David
and Ezra would approach from Lebanon, with a
keen interest in his eyes; but he would not let
any word escape him, until darkness had fallen
and they were not come.</p>
<p>&#8220;He said he would be here at eight, at the
very latest,&#8221; said the mother at length, and she
went to the fire and placed before the burning
coals two chickens to broil.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid David won&#8217;t have much appetite,
unless his model <i>should</i> be approved, and money
is too precious to spend on <i>experiments</i>,&#8221; said Mr.
Bushnell, as she returned to his side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean to tell me you <i>doubt</i>?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I doubt. Jonathan Trumbull is a
man not at all likely to give his consent to anything
that does not commend itself to common sense.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Bushnell was saved the pain of saying his
thought, that he was afraid, if David&#8217;s plan was a
good one, <i>somebody</i> would have thought of it long
ago, for vigorous knuckles were at work upon
the winter-door.</p>
<p>As soon as it was opened the genial form of
good Dr. Gale stood revealed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are the boys back yet?&#8221; he asked, stepping
within.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but we expect them every minute,&#8221; said
Mr. Bushnell.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, friends, I had a patient within three
miles of you to visit, and I thought I&#8217;d come on
and hear the news.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span></div>
<p>Ere he was fully made welcome to hearth and
home, in walked David, with the little Turtle
under his arm. Without ado he went up to his
mother and said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Madam, I present this to you, with Governor
Trumbull&#8217;s compliments. He has ordered your
boy money, men, metals and powder without stint
to work with. <i>Wish me joy, won&#8217;t you?</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>I do not anywhere find a record of the words
in which the joy was wished, on that 2nd of February,
a hundred years ago, but it is easy to
imagine the very tones in which the good, God-loving
Dr. Gale gave thanks for the new blessing
that had that day fallen on his friend&#8217;s house.</p>
<p>It is impossible to follow David Bushnell in his
many journeys to the iron furnaces of Salisbury,
in the spring and early summer of 1776, during
which time the entire country was aroused and
astir from the removal of the American army from
Boston to New York; and our friends at Saybrook
were busy as bees from morning till night,
in getting ready perfect machines for duty.</p>
<p>David Bushnell&#8217;s strength proved insufficient
to navigate one of his Turtles in the tidal waters
of the Sound, and his brother Ezra learned to do
it most perfectly.</p>
<p>In the latter end of June, the British fleet,
which had sailed out of Boston harbor so ingloriously
on the 17th of March, for Halifax, there to
await re-inforcements, appeared in waters adjacent
to New York.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span></div>
<p>The signal of their approach was gladly hailed
by the inventor and by the navigator of the
American Turtle.</p>
<p>A whale-boat from New London, her seamen
sworn to inviolable secrecy, was ordered to be in
the river at a given point, on a given night, for a
service of which the men were utterly ignorant.</p>
<p>On the evening previous, Ezra Bushnell, overworn
by many attempts at navigating the
machine, was taken seriously ill. At midnight he
was delirious&mdash;at day-dawn Dr. Gale was sent for.</p>
<p>When night fell he was in a raging fever, with
no prospect of rapid recovery.</p>
<p>David set off alone, and with a heavy heart, to
meet the boatmen. In the seine-house on Poverty
Island the brothers had stored provisions for a
cruise of several days. To this spot David Bushnell
went alone, and with a saddened heart, for
he knew that it must be many days ere he could
learn of his brother&#8217;s condition.</p>
<p>The New London boatmen were promptly at
the appointed place of meeting.</p>
<p>When they saw the curious thing they were
told to take in tow, their curiosity knew no
bounds; and it was only when assured that it was
dangerous to examine it, that they desisted from
their determination to know all about it, and consented
to obey orders.</p>
<p>When, at last, a departure was made, the hour
was midnight, the tide served, and no ill-timed
discovery was made of the deed.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span></div>
<p>The strong-armed boatmen rowed well and
long, and, as daylight dawned, they were directed
to keep a look-out for Faulkner&#8217;s Island, a small
bit of land in the Sound, nearly five miles from
the Connecticut shore.</p>
<p>The flashing light that illumines the waters at
night for us, did not gleam on them, but nevertheless,
the high brown bank and the little slope
of land looked inviting to weary men, as they
cautiously rowed near to it, not knowing whom
they might meet there.</p>
<p>They landed, made a fire, cooked their food, ate
of it, and lay down to sleep until night should
come again.</p>
<p>They set out early in the ensuing twilight, and
rowed westward all night, in the face of a gentle
wind.</p>
<p>&#8220;If there were only another Faulkner&#8217;s Island
to flee to,&#8221; said Mr. Bushnell, as morning drew
near. &#8220;Do you know (to one of the men) a safe
place to hide in on this coast?&#8221;</p>
<p>They were then off Merwin&#8217;s Point, and between
West Haven and Milford.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s Poquahaug,&#8221; was the reply, with a
momentary catch of the oar, and incline of the
head toward the south-west.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>What</i> is Poquahaug?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A little island, pretty well in, close to shore,
as it were, and, maybe, deserted.&#8221;</p>
<p>After deliberate council had been held it was
resolved to examine the locality.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span></div>
<p>A few years after New Haven and Milford
churches were formed under the oak-tree at New
Haven, this little island, to which they were
fleeing to hide the Turtle from daylight, was
&#8220;granted to Charles Deal for a tobacco plantation,
provided that he would not trade with the
Dutch or Indians;&#8221; but now Indians, Dutch and
Charles Deal alike had left it, the latter with a
rude, sheltering building in place of Ansantawae&#8217;s
big summer wigwam that used to adorn its crest.</p>
<p>To this spot, bright with grass, and green with
full-foliaged trees of oak on its eastern shore, the
weary boatmen, who had had a long, hard pull of
twenty miles to make, came, just as the longest
day&#8217;s sun was at its rising.</p>
<p>They were so glad and relieved <i>and</i> satisfied to
find no one on it.</p>
<p>The Turtle was left at anchor near the shore;
the whale-boat gave up of its provisions, and
presently the little camp was in the enjoyment of
a long day of rest and refreshment.</p>
<p>Should anyone approach from the seaward or
from the mainland, it was determined that the
party should resolve itself into a band of fishermen,
fishing for striped bass, for which the
locality was well known.</p>
<p>As the day wore on, and the falling tide revealed
a line of stones that gradually increased,
as the water fell, to a bar a hundred feet wide,
stretching from the island to the sands of the
Connecticut shore, David Bushnell perceived
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
that the locality was just the proper place in
which to learn and teach the art of navigating the
Turtle. He examined the region well, and then
called the men together.</p>
<p>They were staunch, good-hearted fellows,
accustomed to long pulls in northern seas after
whales, and that they were patriotic he fully believed.
The Turtle was drawn up under the
grassy bank, where the long sedge half hid, and
bushels of rock-weed and sea-drift wholly concealed
it, and then, in a few carefully-chosen
words, David Bushnell entrusted it to the watch
and care of the boatmen.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am going to leave it here, and you with it,
until I return,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Guard it with your
lives if need be. If you handle it, it will be at
the risk of life. If you keep it <i>well</i>, Congress will
reward you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The mystery of the whole affair enchanted the
men. They made faithful promises, and, in the
glorious twilight of the evening, rowed David
Bushnell across the beautiful stretch of Sound
that to-day separates Charles Island from the
comely old town of Milford.</p>
<p>As the whale-boat went up the harbor, a sailing
vessel was getting ready to depart.</p>
<p>Finding that it was bound to New York, David
Bushnell took passage in it the same night.</p>
<p>Two days later, with a letter from Governor
Trumbull to General Washington as his introduction,
the young man, by command of the latter,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
sought out General Parsons, and &#8220;requested him
to furnish him with two or three men to learn the
navigation of his new machine. General Parsons
immediately sent for Ezra Lee, then a sergeant,
and two others, who had <i>offered</i> their services to
go on board a fireship; and, on Bushnell&#8217;s request
being made known to them, they enlisted themselves
under him for this novel piece of service.&#8221;</p>
<p>Returning to Poquahaug (the Indian name of
Charles Island), the American Turtle was found
safe and sound. Here the little party spent many
days in experimenting with it in the waters about
the island; and in the Housatonic River.</p>
<p>During this time the enemy had got possession
of a portion of Long Island, and of Governor&#8217;s
Island in the harbor&mdash;thus preventing the approach
to New York by the East River.</p>
<p>When the appalling news of the battle of Long
Island reached David Bushnell, he resolved, cost
what it might of danger to himself, or hazard
to the Turtle, to get it to New York with all
speed.</p>
<p>To that end he had it conveyed by water to
New Rochelle, there landed and carried across
the country to the Hudson River, and presently
we hear of it as being on a certain night, late in
August, ready to start on its perilous enterprise.</p>
<p>If you will go to-day and stand where the Turtle
floated that night (for the land has since that
time grown outward into the sea), on your right
hand across the Hudson River, you will see New
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
Jersey. At your left, across the East River,
Long Island begins, with the beautiful Governor&#8217;s
Island in the bay just before you, and, looking
to the southward, in the distance, you will
discern Staten Island.</p>
<p>Let us go back to that day and hour.</p>
<p>The precise date of the Turtle&#8217;s voyage down
the bay is not given, but the time must have been
on the night of either the thirtieth or thirty-first
of August. We will choose the thirtieth, and
imagine ourselves standing in the crowd by the
side of Generals Washington and Putnam, to see
the machine start.</p>
<p>Remember, now, where we stand. It is only
<i>last</i> night that <i>our</i> army, defeated, dispirited,
exhausted by battle, lay across the river on
Brooklyn Heights. Behind it, busy with pickaxe
and shovel, the victorious troops of Mother
England were making ready to &#8220;finish&#8221; the
Americans on the morrow.</p>
<p>There were supposed to be twenty-four
thousand of the enemy, only nine thousand
Continentals; and, just ready to enter East River
and cut them off from New York, lay the British
fleet to the north of Staten Island.</p>
<p>As happened at Boston in March, so happened
it last night in New York, a friendly fog held the
heights of Brooklyn in its grasp, while at New
York all was clear.</p>
<p>Under cover of this fog General Washington
withdrew across the river, a mile or more in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
width, <i>nine thousand men</i>, with all their &#8220;baggage,
stores, provisions, horses, and munitions of war,&#8221;
and not a man of the enemy knew that they were
gone until the fog lifted.</p>
<p>Now, as we stand, Long Island, Governor&#8217;s
Island, Staten Island, one and all are under the
control of Britons.</p>
<p>David Bushnell is in a whale-boat, down close
to the Turtle, giving some last important words
of direction to brave Ezra Lee, who has stepped
within it. David Bushnell could not help wishing,
as he did so, that he could take his place and
guide the spirit of the child of his own creation,
in its first great encounter with the world.</p>
<p>The word is given. The brass top of the Turtle
is shut down. Watchful eyes and swift rowers
belonging to the enemy are keeping guard on
Governor&#8217;s Island, by which Ezra Lee must row,
and it is safer to go under water. How crowded
this little pier would be, did the inhabitants but
know what is going on!</p>
<p>The whale-boats start out, David Bushnell in
one of them. They mean to take the Turtle in
tow the minute it is safe to do so and save Ezra
Lee the labor of rowing it until the last minute.</p>
<p>It is eleven o&#8217;clock. All silently they dip the
oars, and hear the sentinels cry from camp and
shore.</p>
<p>Past the island, in safety, at last. They look
for the Turtle. Up it comes, a distant watch-light
gleaming across its brass head disclosing its
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
presence. Once more it is in tow, and Lee is in
the whale-boat.</p>
<p>Down the bay they go, until the lights from the
fleet grow dangerously near.</p>
<p>On the wide, wind-stirred waters of New York
Bay, Ezra Lee gets into the Turtle, and is cast off,
and left alone, for the whale-boats return to New
York.</p>
<p>With the rudder in his hand, and his <i>feet</i> upon
the oars, he pursues his way. The strong ebb
tide flows fast, and, before he is aware of it, it has
drifted him down past the men-of-war.</p>
<p>However, he immediately <i>gets the machine about</i>,
and, &#8220;by hard labor at the crank for the space of
five glasses by the ships&#8217; bells, or two and a half
hours, he arrives under the stern of one of the
ships at about slack water.&#8221;</p>
<p>Day is now beginning to dawn. He can see
the people on board, and hear them talk.</p>
<p>The moment has come for diving. He closes
up quickly overhead, lets in the water, and goes
down under the ship&#8217;s bottom.</p>
<p>He now applies the screw and does all in his
power to make it enter, but in vain; it will not
pierce the ship&#8217;s copper. Undaunted, he paddles
along to a different part, hoping to find a softer
place; but, in doing this, in his hurry and excitement,
he manages the mechanism so that the
Turtle instantly arises to the surface on the east
side of the ship, and is at once exposed to the
piercing light of day.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span></div>
<p>Again he goes under, hoping that he has not
been seen.</p>
<p>This time his courage fails. It is getting to be
day. If the ship&#8217;s boats are sent after him his
escape will be very difficult, well-nigh impossible,
and, if he saves himself at all, it must be by rowing
more than four miles.</p>
<p>He gives up the enterprise with reluctance, and
starts for New York.</p>
<p>Governor&#8217;s Island <i>must</i> be passed by. He
draws near to it, as near as he can venture, and
then submerges the Turtle. Alas! something
has befallen the compass. It will not guide the
rowing under the sea.</p>
<p>Every few minutes he is compelled to rise to
the surface to look out from the top of the
machine to guide his course, and his track grows
very <ins title='Was ziz'>zig</ins>-zag through the waters.</p>
<p>Ah! the soldiers at Governor&#8217;s Island see the
Turtle! Hundreds are gathering upon the
parapet to watch its motions, such a curious boat
as it is, with turret of brass bobbing up and down,
sinking, disappearing&mdash;coming to the surface
again in a manner <i>wholly</i> unaccountable.</p>
<p>Brave Lee knows his danger, and paddles away
for dear life and love of family up in Lyme,
eating breakfast quietly now he remembers, not
knowing his peril.</p>
<p>Once more he goes up to take a lookout, to see
where White-hall slip lies.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span></div>
<p>A glance at Governor&#8217;s Island, and he sees a
barge shove off laden with his enemies.</p>
<p>Down again, and up, and he sees it making for
him. <i>There is no escape!</i> What <i>can</i> he do!</p>
<p>&#8220;If I must die,&#8221; he thinks, &#8220;they shall die with
me!&#8221; and he lets go the magazine.</p>
<p>Nearer and nearer&mdash;the barge is <i>very</i> close.
&#8220;If they pick me up they will pick that up,&#8221;
thinks Lee, &#8220;and we shall all be blown to atoms
together!&#8221;</p>
<p>They are now within a hundred and fifty feet
of the Turtle and they see the magazine that he
has detached.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some horrible Yankee trick!&#8221; cries a British
soldier. &#8220;<i>Beware!</i>&#8221; And they do beware by
turning and rowing with all speed for the island
whence they came.</p>
<p>Poor Lee looks out with amazement to see them
go. He is well-nigh exhausted, <i>and the magazine,
with its dreadful clock-work going on within it, and
its hundred and fifty pounds of powder, ready to go
off at a given moment</i>, is floating on behind him,
borne by the tide.</p>
<p>He strains every muscle to near New York.
He signals the shore.</p>
<p>Since daylight Putnam has been there keeping
watch. David Bushnell has paced up and down
all night, in keen anxiety.</p>
<p>The friendly whale-boats put out to meet him.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, slowly borne by the coming tide,
the magazine floats into the East River.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span></div>
<p>&#8220;It will blow up in five minutes now,&#8221; says
Bushnell, looking at his watch, and he goes to
welcome Ezra Lee.</p>
<p>The five minutes go by.</p>
<p>Suddenly, with tremendous voice, and awful
uproar of the sea, the magazine explodes.</p>
<p>Columns of water toss high in air, mingled
with the oaken ribs that held the powder but a
minute ago.</p>
<p>Consternation seizes British troops on Long
Island. The brave soldiers on the parapet at
Governor&#8217;s Island quake with fear. All New
York rushes to the river-side to find out what it
can mean. Nothing, on all the face of the earth,
<i>ever</i> happened like it before, one and all declare.</p>
<p>Opinion varies concerning it, from bomb to
earthquake, from meteor to water-spout, and
settles down on neither.</p>
<p>Poor Ezra Lee feels that he <i>meant</i> well, but did
not act wisely. David Bushnell praises the
sergeant, and takes all the want of success to himself,
in not going to do his own work.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, with astonishment, Generals Washington
and Putnam and David Bushnell himself
behold, as did the Provincials, <i>after</i> the battle of
<i>Bunker-Breed&#8217;s</i> Hill, <i>victory in defeat</i>, for lo! no
British ship sails up the East River, or appears
to bombard New York.</p>
<p>Silently they weigh anchor and drop down the
bay. The little American Turtle gained a
bloodless victory that day.</p>

<h2>THE BIRTHDAY OF OUR NATION.</h2>
</div>
<p>Bellman Grey and Blue-Eyed Boy
were hurrying up Chestnut street;
the man carried a large key, the boy a
new broom.</p>
<p>It was a very warm morning in a very warm
month of a very warm year; in fact it may as
well be stated at once that it was the Fourth day
of July, 1776, and that Bellman Grey and Blue-Eyed
Boy were in haste to make ready the State
House of Pennsylvania for the birth of the United
States of America. No wonder they were in a
hurry.</p>
<p>In fact, everybody seemed in a hurry that day;
for before Bellman Grey had whisked that new
broom over the floor of Congress Hall, in walked,
arm-in-arm, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good morning, gentlemen,&#8221; said Bellman
Grey. &#8220;You&#8217;ll find the dust settled in the committee-room.
I&#8217;m cleaning house a little extra
to-day for the expected visitor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For the coming heir?&#8221; said Mr. Adams.</p>
<p>&#8220;When Liberty comes, She comes to stay,&#8221;
said Mr. Jefferson, half-suffocated with the dust;
and the two retreated to the committee-room.</p>
<p>Blue-Eyed Boy was polishing with his silken
duster the red morocco of a chair as the gentlemen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
opened the door. He heard one of them
say, &#8220;If C&#230;sar Rodney gets here, it will be
done.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s done,&#8221; said the boy, &#8220;won&#8217;t you, please,
Mr. Adams, won&#8217;t you, please, Mr. Jefferson, let
me carry the news to General Washington?&#8221;</p>
<p>The two gentlemen looked either at the other,
and both at the lad, in smiling wonder.</p>
<p>&#8220;If what is done?&#8221; asked Mr. Adams.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the thing is voted and signed and made
sure,&#8221; (just here Blue-Eyed Boy waved his duster
of a flag and stood himself as erect as a flagpole;)
&#8220;if the tree&#8217;s transplanted, if the ship gets
off the ways, if we run clear away from King
George, sir; so far away that he&#8217;ll never catch
us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And why do you, my lad, wish to carry the
news to General Washington?&#8221; asked Mr. Jefferson.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; said the boy, &#8220;why&mdash;wouldn&#8217;t you?
It&#8217;ll be jolly work for the soldiers when they
know they can fight for themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just here Bellman Grey shouted for Blue-Eyed
Boy, bidding him come quick and be spry with
his dusting, too.</p>
<p>Before the hall was cleared of the accumulated
dust of State-rooms above and Congress-rooms
below, in came members of the Congress, one-by-one
and two-by-two, and in groups. The doors
were locked, and the solemn deliberations began.
Within that room, now known as Independence
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
Hall, sat, in solemn conclave, half a hundred men,
each and every one of whom knew full well that
the deed about to be done would endanger his
own life.</p>
<p>On a table lay a paper, awaiting signatures. A
silver ink-stand held the ink that trembled and
wavered to the sound and stir of John Adams&#8217;s
voice, as he stated once more the why and the
wherefore of the step America was about to take.</p>
<p>This final statement was made for the especial
enlightenment of three gentlemen, new members
of the Congress from New Jersey, and in reply to
the reasons given by Mr. Dickinson why the
Declaration of Independence should <i>not</i> be made.</p>
<p>In the meantime Bellman Grey was up in the
steeple, &#8220;seeing what he could see,&#8221; and Blue-Eyed
Boy was answering knocks at the entrance
doors; then running up the stairs to tell the
scraps of news that he had gleaned through open
door, or crack, or key-hole.</p>
<p>The day wore on; outside a great and greater
crowd surged every moment against the walls;
but the walls of the State House were thick, and
the crowd was hushed to silence, with intense
longing to hear what was going on inside.</p>
<p>From his high-up place in the belfry, where he
had been on watch, Bellman Grey espied a figure
on horseback, hurrying toward the scene; the
horse was white with heat and hurry; the rider&#8217;s
&#8220;face was no bigger than an apple,&#8221; but it was a
face of importance that day.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Run!&#8221; shouted Bellman Grey from the belfry.
&#8220;Run and tell them that Mr. Rodney
comes.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boy descended the staircase with a bound
and a leap and a thump against the door, and
announced C&#230;sar Rodney&#8217;s approach.</p>
<p>In he came, weary with his eighty miles in the
saddle, through heat and hunger and dust, for
Delaware had sent her son in haste to the scene.</p>
<p>The door closed behind him and all was as still
and solemn as before.</p>
<p>Up in the belfry the old man stroked fondly the
tongue of the bell, and softly said under his breath
again and again as the hours went: &#8220;They will
never do it; they will never do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boy sat on the lowest step of the staircase,
alternately peeping through the key-hole with
eye to see and with ear to hear. At last, came a
stir within the room. He peeped again. He saw
Mr. Hancock, with white and solemn face, bend
over the paper on the table, stretch forth his
hand, and dip the pen in the ink. He watched
that hand and arm curve the pen to and fro over
the paper, and then he was away up the stairs
like a cat.</p>
<p>Breathless with haste, he cried up the belfry:
&#8220;<i>He&#8217;s a doing it, he is!</i> I saw him through the
key-hole. Mr. Hancock has put his name to that
big paper on the table.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go back! go back! you young fool, and keep
watch, and tell me quick when to ring!&#8221; cried
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
down the voice of Bellman Grey, as he wiped for
the hundredth time the damp heat from his forehead
and the dust from the iron tongue beside
him.</p>
<p>Blue-Eyed Boy went back and peeped again
just in time to see Mr. Samuel Adams in the
chair, pen in hand.</p>
<p>One by one, in &#8220;solemn silence all,&#8221; the members
wrote their names, each one knowing full
well, that unless the Colonists could fight longer
and stronger than Great Britain, that signature
would prove his own death-warrant.</p>
<p>It was fitting that the men who wrote their
names that day should write with solemn deliberation.</p>
<p>Blue-Eyed Boy peeped again. &#8220;I hope they&#8217;re
almost done,&#8221; he sighed; &#8220;and I reckon they
are, for Mr. Rodney has the pen now. My! how
tired and hot his face looks! I don&#8217;t believe he
has had any more dinner to-day than I have, and
I feel most awful empty. It&#8217;s almost night by
this time, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>At length the long list was complete. Every
man then present had signed the Declaration of
Independence, except Mr. Dickinson of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>And now came the moment wherein the news
should begin its journey around the world. The
Speaker, Mr. Thompson, arose and made the
announcement to the very men who already
knew it.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span></div>
<p>Blue-Eyed Boy peeped with his ear and heard
the words through the key-hole.</p>
<p>With a shout and a cry of &#8220;Ring! ring!&#8221; and
a clapping of hands, he rushed upward to the
belfry. The words, springing from his lips like
arrows, sped their way into the ears and hands of
Bellman Grey. Grasping the iron tongue of the
old bell, backward and forward he hurled it a
hundred times, its loud voice proclaiming to all
the people that down in Independence Hall a
new nation was born to the earth that day.</p>
<p>When the members heard its tones swinging
out the joyous notes they marvelled, because no
one had authorized the announcement. When
the key was turned from within, and the door
opened, there stood the mystery facing them, in
the person of Blue-Eyed Boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I told him to ring; I heard the news!&#8221; he
shouted, and opened the State House doors to let
the Congress out and all the world in.</p>
<p>You know the rest; the acclamation of the
multitude, the common peals (they forgot to be
careful of powder that night in the staid old city),
the big bonfires, and the illuminations that rang
and roared and boomed and burned from Delaware
to Schuylkill.</p>
<p>In the waning light of the latest bonfire, up
from the city of Penn, rode our Blue-Eyed Boy&mdash;true
to his purpose to be the first to carry the
glad news to General Washington.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be like meeting an old friend,&#8221; he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
thought; for had he not seen the commander-in-chief
every day going in and out of the Congress
Hall during his visit to Philadelphia only a month
ago?</p>
<p>The self-appointed courier never deemed other
evidence of the truth of his news needful than
his own &#8220;word of mouth.&#8221; He rode a strong
young horse, which, early in the year, had been
left in his care by a southern officer when on his
way to the camp at Cambridge; and that no one
might worry about him, he had taken the precaution
to intrust his secret to a neighbor lad to tell
at the home-door in the light of early day.</p>
<p>The journey was long, too long to write of here.
Suffice it to say, that on Sunday morning Blue-Eyed
Boy reached the ferry at the Hudson river.
The old ferryman hesitated to cross with the
lad.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait at my house until the cool of the evening,&#8221;
he urged.</p>
<p>But Blue-Eyed Boy said, &#8220;No, I must cross
this morning, and my pony: I&#8217;ll pay for two if
you&#8217;ll take me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The ferryman crossed the river with the boy,
who, on the other side, inquired his way to the
headquarters of the general.</p>
<p>Warm, tired, hungry, and dusty, he urged his
pony forward to the place, only to find that he
whom he sought had gone to divine service at
St. Paul&#8217;s church.</p>
<p>Blue-Eyed Boy rode to St. Paul&#8217;s. In the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
Fields (now City Hall Park) he tied his faithful
horse, and went his way to the church.</p>
<p>Gently and with reverent mien, he entered the
open door, and listened to the closing words of
the sermon. At length the service was over and
the congregation turned toward the entrance
where stood the young traveler, his heart beating
with exultant pride at the glorious news he
had to tell to the glorious commander.</p>
<p>How grand the General looked to the boy, as,
with stately step, he trod slowly the church aisle
accompanied by his officers.</p>
<p>Now he was come to the vestibule. It was
Blue-Eyed Boy&#8217;s chance at last. The great,
dancing, gleeful eyes, that have outlived in fame
the very name of the lad, were fixed on Washington,
as he stepped forward to accost him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Out of the way!&#8221; exclaimed a guard, and
thrust him aside.</p>
<p>&#8220;I <i>will</i> speak! General Washington!&#8221; screamed
Blue-Eyed Boy, in sudden excitement. The idea
of anybody who had seen, even through a key-hole,
the signing of the Declaration of Independence,
being thrust aside thus!</p>
<p>General Washington stayed his steps and
ordered, &#8220;Let the lad come to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve good news for you,&#8221; said the youth.</p>
<p>&#8220;What news?&#8221;</p>
<p>Officers stood around&mdash;even the congregation
paused, having heard the cry.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s for you alone, General Washington.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span></div>
<p>The lad&#8217;s eyes were ablaze now. All the light
of Philadelphia&#8217;s late illuminations burned in
them. General Washington bade the youth follow him.</p>
<p>&#8220;But my pony is tied yonder,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and
he&#8217;s hungry and tired too. I can&#8217;t leave him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come hither, then,&#8221; and the Commander-in-chief
withdrew with the lad within the sacred
edifice.</p>
<p>&#8220;General Washington,&#8221; said Blue-Eyed Boy,
&#8220;on Thursday Congress declared <i>us</i> free and
independent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are your dispatches?&#8221; leaped from
the General&#8217;s lips, his face shining.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;why, I haven&#8217;t any, but it&#8217;s all true,
sir,&#8221; faltered the boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you find it out?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was right there, sir. Don&#8217;t you remember
me? I help Bellman Grey take care of the State
House at Philadelphia, and I run on errands for
the Congress folks, too, sometimes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did Congress send you on this errand?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, General Washington; I can&#8217;t tell a lie, I
came myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you know me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Blue-Eyed Boy was ready to cry now. To be
sure he was sturdy and strong, and nearly fourteen,
too; but to be doubted, after all his long,
tiresome journey, was hard. However, he winked
once or twice violently, and then he looked his
very soul into the General&#8217;s face, and said: &#8220;Why,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
I saw you every day you went to Congress, only
a month ago, I did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe you, my lad. Get your horse and
follow me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blue-Eyed Boy followed on, and waited in camp
until the tardy despatches came in on Tuesday
morning, confirming every word that he had
spoken.</p>
<p>The same evening all the brigades in and
around New York were ordered to their respective
parade-grounds.</p>
<p>Blue-Eyed Boy was admitted within the hollow
square formed by the brigades on the spot
where stands the City Hall. Within the same
square was General Washington, sitting on horseback,
and the great Declaration was read by one
of his aids.</p>
<p>It is needless to tell how it was received by the
eager men who listened to the mighty truths
with reverent, uncovered heads. Henceforth
every man felt that he had a banner under which
to fight, as broad as the sky above him, as sheltering
as the homely roof of home.</p>

<h2>THE OVERTHROW OF THE STATUE OF KING GEORGE.</h2>
</div>
<p>If, on the evening of July 9, 1876, at six
of the clock, you go and stand where
the shadow of the steeple of St. Paul&#8217;s
church in New York is falling, you
will occupy the space General Washington occupied,
just one hundred years ago, when with uncovered
head and reverent mien, he, in the presence
of and surrounded by a brigade of noble
soldiers, listened to the reading of the Declaration
of Independence.</p>
<p>You will remember that at the church door on
Sunday, Blue-Eyed Boy brought to him, by word
of mouth, the great news that a nation was born
on Thursday.</p>
<p>This news was now, for the first time, announced
to the men of New York and New
England.</p>
<p>No wonder that their military caps came off on
Tuesday, that their arms swung in the air, and
their voices burst forth into one loud acclaim
that might have been heard by the British foe
then landing on Staten Island.</p>
<p>As you stand there, and the shadow of old St.
Paul swings around and covers you, shut your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
eyes and listen. Something of the olden music,
of the loud acclaim, may swing around with the
shadow and fall on your ears, since no motion is
ever spent, no sound ever still.</p>
<p>On that night, when the grand burst of enthusiasm
had arisen, Blue-Eyed Boy said to General
Washington: &#8220;I am afraid, sir, if Congress had
known, they never would have done it, never!
It seemed easy to do it in Philadelphia, where
everything is just as it used to be; but here, with
all the British ships riding in, full of soldiers, and
guns enough in them to smash the old State
House where they did it! If they&#8217;d only known
about the ships!&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Ah! Blue-Eyed Boy. You didn&#8217;t keep your
eye very close to Congress Hall in the morning
of last Thursday, or you would have heard Mr.
Hancock or Mr. Thompson read to Congress a
letter from General Washington, announcing the
arrival of General Howe at Sandy Hook with
one hundred and ten ships of war.</p>
<p>No, no! Blue-Eyed Boy and every other boy;
the men who dared to say, and sign their names
to the assertion, &#8220;A nation is born to-day,&#8221; did
not do it under the rosy flush of glorious victory,
but in the fast-coming shadow of mighty Britain,
strong in all the power and radiant with all the
pomp of war.</p>
<p>And what had a few little colonies to meet
them with? They had, it is true, a new name,
that of &#8220;States&#8221;; but cannon and camp-kettles
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
alike were wanting; the small powder mills in
the Connecticut hive could yield them only a
fragment of the black honey General Washington
cried for, day and night, from Cambridge to
New York; the houses of the inhabitants, diligently
searched for fragments of lead, gave them
not enough; and you know how every homestead
in New England was besieged for the last
yard of homespun cloth, that the country&#8217;s soldiers
might not go coatless by day and tentless
at night.</p>
<p>Brave men and women good!</p>
<p>Let us hurrah for them all, if it is a hundred
years too late for them to hear. The men of a
hundred years to come will remember our huzzas
of this year, and grow, it may be, the braver and
the better for them all.</p>
<p>But now General Washington has ridden away
to his home at Number One in the Broadway;
the brigade has moved on, and even Blue-Eyed
Boy is hastening after General Washington, intent
on taking a farewell glance, from the rampart
of Fort George, at the far-away English ships.</p>
<p>To-morrow he will begin his homeward journey
through the Jerseys. His pass is in his pocket,
and as he quickens his steps, he sees groups
gathering here and there, and knows that some
excitement is astir in the public mind, but thinks
it is all about the great Declaration.</p>
<p>He reaches Wall street, and the sun is at its
going down. Up from the East river come the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
sounds of orderly drummers drumming, of regimental
fifers fifing. He stays his steps, and
stands listening: he sees a brigade marching the
&#8220;grand parade&#8221; at sunset.</p>
<p>Up it comes from Wall street to Smith street;
(I am sure I do not know what Smith street is
lost into now, but the orderly-book of Major
Phineas Porter of Waterbury, one hundred years
old to-morrow morning, has it &#8220;Smith street&#8221;);
from the upper end of Smith street back to Wall
street, and the young Philadelphian follows it,
marching to sound of fife and drum.</p>
<p>As it turns towards the East river, he remembers
whither he was bound and starts off with
speed for the Grand Battery.</p>
<p>As he goes, glancing backward, he sees that all
the town is at his heels.</p>
<p>He begins to run. All the town begins to run.
He runs faster: the crowd runs faster. It is
shouting now. He tries to listen; but his feet are
flying, his head is bobbing, his hat is falling, and
this is what he thinks he hears in the midst of
all: &#8220;Down with him! Down with the Tory!&#8221;
It is &#8220;tyrant&#8221; that they cry, but he hears it as
&#8220;tory,&#8221; and he knows full well how Governor
Franklin of New Jersey and Mayor Matthews of
New York have just been sent off to Connecticut
for safer keeping, and he does not care to go into
New England just now, so he flies faster than
ever, fully believing that the crowd pursues him,
as a Royalist.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span></div>
<p>Just before him opens the Bowling Green.
Into it he darts, hoping to find covert, but there
is none at hand.</p>
<p>Right in the midst of the enclosure stands an
equestrian statue of King George the Third.</p>
<p>It is high; it looks safe. Blue-Eyed Boy makes
for it, utterly ignorant of what it is.</p>
<p>The crowd surges on. It is now at the gate.
The young martyr makes a spring at the leg and
tail of the horse; he swings himself aloft, he
catches and clutches and climbs, and in the midst
of ringing shouts of &#8220;Down with him! Down
with horse and king!&#8221; Blue-Eyed Boy gets over
King George and clings to the up-reared neck of
the leaden horse; thence he turns his wild-eyed
face to the throng below. &#8220;Down with him! He
don&#8217;t hear! He won&#8217;t hear!&#8221; cry the populace.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do hear!&#8221; in wild afright, shrieks Blue-Eyed
Boy, &#8220;and I&#8217;m not a Tory.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shut your eyes again, and see the picture as it
stands there in the waning light of the ninth of
July, 1776.</p>
<p>Four years ago, over the ocean, borne by loyal
subjects to a loyal colony, it came, this statue,
that you shall see. It is a noble horse, though
made of lead, that stands there, poised on its
hinder legs, its neck in air. King George sits
erect, the crown of Great Britain on his head, a
sword in his left hand, his right grasping the
bridle-lines, and over all, a sheen of gold, for
horse and king were gilded.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span></div>
<p>King George faces the bay, and looks vainly
down. All his brave ships and eight thousand
Red Coats, yesterday landed on yonder island,
cannot save him now. Had he listened to the
petitions of his children it might have been, but
he would not hear their just plaints, and now his
statue, standing so firm against storm, wind and
time, trembles before the sea of wrath surging at
its base.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come down, come down, you young rascal!&#8221;
cries a strong voice to Blue-Eyed Boy, but his
hands grasped at either ear of the horse, and he
clings with all his strength to resist the pull of a
dozen hands at his feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come down, you rogue, or we&#8217;ll topple you
over with his majesty, King George,&#8221; greets the
lad&#8217;s ears, and opens them to his situation.</p>
<p>&#8220;King George!&#8221; cried Blue-Eyed Boy with a
sudden sense of his ridiculous fear and panic, and
he yields to the stronger influence exerted on his
right leg, and so comes to earth with emotions of
relief and mortification curiously mingled in his
young mind.</p>
<p>To think that he had had the vanity to imagine
the crowd pursued him, and so has flown from
his own friends to the statue of King George for
safety!</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t tell,&#8221; thinks the lad, &#8220;a word about
this to anyone at home,&#8221; and then he falls to
pushing the men who are pushing the statue,
and over it topples, horse and rider, down upon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
the sod of the little United States, just five days
old.</p>
<p>How they hew it! How they hack it! How
they saw at it with saw and penknife! Blue-Eyed
Boy himself cuts off the king&#8217;s ear, that will not
hear the petitions of people or Congress, proudly
pockets it, and walks off, thankful because he carries
his own on his head.</p>
<p>Would you like to know what General Washington
thought about the overthrow of the statue
in Bowling Green?</p>
<p>We will turn to Phineas Porter&#8217;s orderly-book,
and copy from the general orders for July 10,
1776, what he said to the soldiers about it:</p>
<p>&#8220;The General doubts not the persons who
pulled down and mutilated the statue in the
Broad-way last night were actuated by zeal in
the public cause, yet it has so much the appearance
of riot and want of order in the army, that
he disapproves the manner and directs that in
future such things shall be avoided by the soldiers,
and be left to be executed by proper
authority.&#8221;</p>
<p>The same morning, the heavy ear of the king
in his pocket, Blue-Eyed Boy, once more on his
pony, sets off to cross the ferry on his way
to Philadelphia. We leave him caught in the
mazes of the Flying Camp gathering at Amboy;
whither by day and by night have been ferried
over from Staten Island, all the flocks of sheep
and herds of cattle that could be gotten away&mdash;lest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
the hungry men in red coats, coming up the
bay, seize upon and destroy them.</p>
<p>Ah! what days, what days and nights too were
those for the young United States to pass
through!</p>
<p>To-day, we echo what somebody wrote somewhere,
even then, amid all the darkness&mdash;words
we would gladly see on our banner&#8217;s top-most
fold:</p>
<p>&#8220;The United States! Bounded by the ocean
and backed by the forest. Whom hath she to
fear but her God?&#8221;</p>

<h2>SLEET AND SNOW.</h2>
</div>
<p>Fourth of July, 1776.&mdash;Troublous
times, that day? Valentine Kull thought
so, as he stood in a barn-yard, with a
portion of his mother&#8217;s clothes line tied
as tightly as he dared to tie it around the neck of a
calf. He was waiting for the bars to be let down
by his sister. Anna Kull thought the times decidedly
troublous, as she pulled and pushed and
lifted to get the bars down.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t do it, Valentine,&#8221; she cried, her half-child
face thrust between the rails.</p>
<p>&#8220;Try again!&#8221;</p>
<p>She tried. Result as before.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come over, then, and hold Snow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anna went over, rending gown and apron on
the roughnesses of rails and haste. Never mind.
She was over, and could, she thought, hold the
calf.</p>
<p>Barn-yard, cow (I forgot to mention that there
was a cow); calf, and children, one and all, were
on Staten Island in the Bay and Province of New
York. Beside these, there was a house. It was
so small, so queer, so old-fashioned, so Amsterdam
Dutchy, that, for all that I know to the contrary,
Achter Kull may have built it as a play-house
for his children when first he came to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
America and took up his abode by the Kill van
Kull. The Kill van Kull is that curious little
slice of sea pinched in by a finger of New Jersey
thrust hard against Staten Island, as though trying
its best to push the island off to sea. However
it may have been, there was the house, and
from the very roof of it arose a head, neck, two
shoulders and one arm; the same being the
property of the mother of Valentine and Anna.
The said mother was keeping watch from the
scuttle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Be quick, my children,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;The
Continentals are now driving off Abraham <ins title="Was Ryker's">Rycker&#8217;s</ins>
cattle and the boat isn&#8217;t full yet. They&#8217;ll be <i>here</i>
next.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anna seized the clothes line; Valentine made
for the bars. Down they came, the one after the
other, and out over the lower one went calf, Anna
and cow. Valentine made a dive for Snow&#8217;s leading
string. He missed it. Away went the calf,
poor Anna clutching at the rope, into green lane,
through tall grass, tangle and thicket. She caught
her foot in her torn gown and was falling, when a
sudden holding up of the rope assisted by Valentine&#8217;s
clutch at her arm set her on her feet again.
During this slight respite from the chase, the cow
(Sleet, by name, because not quite so white as
Snow) took a bite of grass and wondered what
all this unaccustomed fuss did mean.</p>
<p>&#8220;Snow has pulled my arm out of joint,&#8221; said
Anna, holding fast to her shoulder.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Never mind your arm, <i>now</i>,&#8221; returned Valentine.
&#8220;We must get to the marsh. It&#8217;s the only
place. You get a switch, and if Sleet won&#8217;t follow
Snow in, you drive her. I <i>wish</i> the critters
wasn&#8217;t white; they show up so; but Washington
sha&#8217;n&#8217;t have this calf and cow, <i>anyhow</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>From Newark Bay to Old Blazing Star Ferry
stretched the marsh, deep, dense, well-nigh impassable.
Under the orders of General Washington,
supported by the approval of the Provincial
Congress in session at White Plains, the live stock
was being driven from the island, and ferried
across Staten Island Sound to New Jersey. At
the same moment the grand fleet of armed ships
from Halifax, England, and elsewhere, was sailing
in with General Howe on board and Red Coats
enough to eat, at a supper and a dinner, all the
live stock on a five-by-seventeen mile island.</p>
<p>Now the Commander-in-chief of the Continental
forces at New York did not wish to afford the aid
and comfort to the enemy of furnishing horses to
draw cannon, or fresh meat wherewith to satisfy
the hunger of British soldier and sailor. Oh no!
On Manhattan Island were braves&mdash;for freedom
toiling day and night; building earthwork, redoubt
and battery with never a luxury from
morning to morning, except the luxury of fighting
for Liberty. Soldiers from camp, light-horse and
militia from New Jersey, had gathered on the
island, and had been at work a day and a night
when the news came to the Kull cottage that in a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
few minutes its cow and calf would be called for.
Hence the sudden watch from the roof, and the
escapade from the barn-yard.</p>
<p>The Kull father, I regret to write, because it
seems highly unpatriotic, had gone forth to catch
fish that day, hugging up the thought close to his
pocket of a heart, that the English fleet would
pay well for fresh fish.</p>
<p>Now Sleet and Snow were treasures untold to
Valentine and Anna Kull. Anna&#8217;s pocket-money,
stored up to be spent once-a-year in New York,
came to her hands by the sale of butter to oystermen;
and the calf, Snow, was the exclusive
property of her brother Valentine. No wonder
they were striving to save their possessions&mdash;ignorant,
children as they were, of every good
which they could not see and feel.</p>
<p>Cow and calf, or rather calf and cow, never
before were given such a race. Highways were
ignored. There were not many beaten tracks at
that time on Staten Island. Daisied and clovered
fields the calf was dragged through; young corn
and potato lots suffered alike by the pressure of
hoof and foot. Anna nearly forgot her out-of-joint
arm when the four reached the marsh. Its
friendly-looking shelter was hailed with delight.</p>
<p>Said Valentine, tugging the tired calf, to Anna,
switching forward the anxious cow: &#8220;I should
like to see the riflemen from Pennsylvania and
the <i>Yankeys</i> from Doodle or Dandy either, chase
Sleet and Snow through <i>this</i> marsh.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span></div>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been <i>awful</i> work though to get &#8217;em here,&#8221;
said Anna, wiping her face with a pink handkerchief
suddenly detached for use from her gown.</p>
<p>In plunged the boy and up s-s-cissed a cloud of
mosquitoes, humming at the sound of the new-come
feast; fresh flesh and blood from the uplands
was desirable.</p>
<p>The grass was green, <i>very</i> green&mdash;lovely, bright,
<i>light</i> green; the July sun shone down untiringly;
the tide rushing up from Raritan Bay met the
tide rolling over from Newark Bay, and the cool,
sweet swash of water snaked along the stout
sedge, making it sway and bend as though the
wind were sweeping its tops.</p>
<p>When within the queer infolding, boy, cow, and
calf had disappeared, Anna called: &#8220;I&#8217;ll run now
and keep watch and tell you when the soldiers
are gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, <i>you won&#8217;t</i>!&#8221; shrieked back her brother;
&#8220;you&#8217;ll stay <i>here</i>, and help me, or the skeeters
will kill the critters. Bring me the biggest bush
you can find, and fetch one for yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anna always obeyed Valentine. It was a way
she had. He liked it, and, generally speaking,
she didn&#8217;t greatly dislike it, but her dress was
thinner than his coat, and the happy mosquitoes
knew she was fairer and sweeter than her Dutch
brother, and didn&#8217;t mind telling her so in the
most insinuating fashion possible. On this occasion,
as she had in so many other unlike instances,
she acceded to his request; toiling backward up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
the ascent and fetching thence an armful of the
stoutest boughs she could twist from branches.</p>
<p>She neared the marsh on her return. All that
she could discern was a straw hat bobbing hither
and thither; the horns of a cow tossing to and
fro; the tail of a cow lashing the air.</p>
<p>A voice she heard, shouting forth in impatient
bursts of sound, &#8220;Anna, Anna Kull!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Here!</i> I&#8217;m coming,&#8221; she responded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurry up! I&#8217;m eaten alive. Snow&#8217;s crazy and
Sleet&#8217;s a lunatic,&#8221; shouted her brother, jerking
the words forth between the vain dives his hand
made into the cloud of wings in the air.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sakes alive!&#8221; said poor Anna, toiling from
sedge bog to sedge bog with her burden of
&#8220;bushes&#8221; and striving to hide her face from the
mosquitoes as she went.</p>
<p>It was nearly noon-day then, and the Fourth of
July too, but neither Valentine nor Anna thought
of the day of the month. Why should they?
The Nation wasn&#8217;t born yet whose hundredth
birthday we keep this year.</p>
<p>The solemn assembly of earnest men&mdash;debating
the to be or not to be of the United States&mdash;was
over there at work in Congress Hall in the old
State House. They were heated with sun and
brick and argument; a hundred and ten British
ships of war were anchoring and at anchor over
on the ocean side of Staten Island. Up the bay,
seven or eight thousand troops in &#8220;ragged regimentals&#8221;
were working to make ready for battle;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
but not one of them all suffered more from sun
and toil and anxiety and greed of blood than did
the lad and the lass in the marsh.</p>
<p>They fought it out, with many a sting and smart,
another hour, and then declaring that &#8220;cow <ins title='Was of'>or</ins> no
cow they couldn&#8217;t stay another minute,&#8221; they
strove to work their way out of the beautiful
green of the sedge.</p>
<p>On the meadow-land stood their mother. She
had brought dinner for her hungry children,&mdash;moreover,
she had brought news.</p>
<p>The Yankee troops&mdash;the Jersey militia&mdash;had
gone, but the British soldiers had arrived and
demanded beef&mdash;beef raw, beef roasted, beef in
any form.</p>
<p>The tears that the fiercest mosquito had failed
to extort from Anna came now. &#8220;I wish I&#8217;d let
her go,&#8221; she cried, fondly stroking Sleet. &#8220;At
least she wouldn&#8217;t have been killed, and we&#8217;d had
her again sometime, maybe; but now&mdash;I say,
Valentine, are <i>you</i> going to give up Snow?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I <i>ain&#8217;t</i>,&#8221; stoutly persisted the lad, slapping
with his broad palm the panting side of the
calf, where mosquitoes still clung.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, my poor children,&#8221; said Mother Kull,
&#8220;you will <i>have</i> to. It <i>can&#8217;t</i> be helped. If we
refuse them, don&#8217;t you know, they will burn our
house down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>If they do, I&#8217;ll kill them!</i>&#8221; The words shot out
from the gunpowdery temper of Anna Kull.
Poor innocent girl of thirteen! She never in her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
life had seen an act of cruelty greater than the
taking of a fish or the death of a chicken; but the
impotent impulse of revenge arose within her at
the bare idea of having her pet, her pretty Sleet,
taken from her and eaten by soldiers.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better keep still, Anna Kull,&#8221; said
Valentine. &#8220;Mother, don&#8217;t you think we might
hide the animals somewhere?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221; echoed the poor woman, looking
up and looking down.</p>
<p>Truly there seemed to be no place. Already
six thousand British soldiers had landed and taken
possession of the island. Hills and forests were
not high enough nor deep enough; and now the
very marsh had cast them out by its army of
winged stingers&mdash;more dreadful than human foe.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just wish,&#8221; ejaculated the poor sunburned,
mosquito-tortured, hungry girl, who stood between
marsh and meadow,&mdash;&#8220;I <i>wish</i> I had &#8217;em
every one tied hand and foot and dumped into
the sedge where we&#8217;ve been. Mother, I wouldn&#8217;t
use Sleet&#8217;s milk to-night, not a drop of it,&mdash;it&#8217;s
crazy milk, I know: she&#8217;s been tortured so. Poor
cow! poor creature! poor, dear, nice, honest
Sleet!&#8221; And Anna patted the cow with loving
stroke and laid her head on its neck.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, children, eat something, and then we&#8217;ll
all go home together,&mdash;if they haven&#8217;t carried off
our cot already,&#8221; said the mother.</p>
<p>They sat down under a tree and ate with the
eager, wholesome appetite of children. Mrs.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
Kull kept watch that the cow did not wander
far from the place.</p>
<p>As they were eating, Valentine said to Anna,
nodding his head in the direction of his mother:
&#8220;I&#8217;ve thought of something. We must manage
to send <i>her</i> home without us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>I&#8217;ve</i> thought of something,&#8221; responded Anna.
&#8220;Yes, we <i>must</i> manage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should like to know <i>what</i> you could think
of, sister.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Should you? Why, think of saving the cow
and calf, of course; though, if you&#8217;re <i>very</i>
particular, you can leave the calf here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what will you do with the cow?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Put her in the boat&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whew!&#8221; interrupted Valentine.</p>
<p>&#8220;And ferry her over the sound,&#8221; continued
Anna.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You and me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think we could?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We can try.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s brave! How&#8217;s your arm?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right! I jerked it back, slapping
mosquitoes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Give us another hunkey piece of bread and
butter. Honey&#8217;s good to-day. I wonder mother
thought about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I s&#8217;pose,&#8221; said Anna, &#8220;she&#8217;d as leave we had
it as soldiers. Wouldn&#8217;t it be jolly if we could
make &#8217;em steal the bees?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span></div>
<p>The wind blew east. Up came martial sounds
mingled with the break and the roar of the ocean.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dear! They&#8217;re a coming,&#8221; gasped Mrs.
Kull, running to the spot. &#8220;They&#8217;re coming, and
your father is not here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hide, hide, my children! Never mind the
cow now,&#8221; she almost shrieked; her mind was
running wild with all the scenes of terror she had
ever heard of.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pshaw! pshaw! Mother Kull,&#8221; said her boy,
assuringly. &#8220;They won&#8217;t come down here.
Somebody&#8217;s guiding them around who knows
just where every house is. You and Anna get
into that thicket yonder and keep, whatever
happens, as still as mice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;ll <i>you</i> do, bub?&#8221; questioned Anna, her
sunburned face brown-pale with affright.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll take care of myself. Boys always do.&#8221;</p>
<p>As soon as Mrs. Kull and her daughter were
well concealed in the thicket, the sounds began
to die away. They waited half an hour. All was
still. They crept out, gazing the country over.
No soldier in sight. Down in the marsh again
were boy and cow.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll run home now,&#8221; said Mrs. Kull. &#8220;I dare
say &#8217;twas all a trick of my ears.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I heard it, too, Mother Kull.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your ears serve you tricks, too, Anna. You
wait and help Valentine home with the animals.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anna was glad to have her mother gone. She
sped to the marsh. She threaded it, until by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
sundry signs she found the trio and summoned
them forth.</p>
<p>The old Blazing Star Ferry was seldom used.
A boat lay there. It was staunch. The tide with
them, they <i>might</i> get it across. Had they been
older, wiser, they would never have made the
attempt.</p>
<p>A fresh water stream ran down to the sea.
They passed it on their way thither. In it Sleet
drank deep, and soothed for a moment the bites
that tormented her; the children kneeled on the
grassy bank, and drank from their palms; the
calf frolicked in it, till driven out. An hour went
by. They reached the ferry. It was deserted.
Somebody had used the boat that day. It was at
the shore. Grass was yet in it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come along, Snow,&#8221; said Valentine, urging
with the rope. &#8220;Go along, Snow,&#8221; said Anna,
helping it on with a stout twig she had picked up.
The calf pranced and ran, and before it knew its
whereabouts was in the broad-bottomed boat.
Sleet stood on the shore, and saw her baby tied
fast. One poor cry the calf uttered. It went
home to the motherly heart of the dumb creature.
She went down the sand, over the side, and
began, in her own way, to comfort Snow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now we are all right!&#8221; cried Valentine,
delighted with the success of his ruse; for he had
slyly, lest Anna should see the deed, thrust a pin
in Snow to call forth the cry and win the cow
over to his side.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Take an oar quick!&#8221; commanded the young
captain.</p>
<p>His mate obeyed. They pushed the boat out,
unfastened it from the pier. Before anybody
concerned had time to realize the situation the
boat was adrift, and they were whirling in the tide.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, sis,&#8221; said Valentine, a big lump in his
throat, &#8220;we&#8217;re in for it. It is sink or swim. It&#8217;s
not much use to row. You steer and I&#8217;ll paddle.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sleet looked wildly around. She tossed her
head, sniffed the salt, oystery air, and seemed
about to plunge overboard.</p>
<p>Anna screamed. Valentine threw down his
paddle and dashed himself on the boat&#8217;s outermost
edge just in time to save it from overturning.
Mistress Sleet, disgusted with Fourth of July, had
made up her mind to lie down and take a nap.
The boat righted and they were safe. Staten
Island Sound at this point was narrow, scarcely
more than a quarter of a mile in width, and the
tide was fast bearing them out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Such uncommon good sense in Sleet,&#8221; exclaimed
the boy. &#8220;<i>That</i> cow is worth saving.&#8221;</p>
<p>At that moment a dozen Red Coats were at the
ferry they had just left. The imperious gentlemen
were in a fine frenzy at finding the boat gone.</p>
<p>They shouted to the children to return.</p>
<p>&#8220;Steady, steady now,&#8221; cried the young captain.
His mate was steady at the helm until a musket
ball or two ran past them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let go!&#8221; shouted the captain. &#8220;Swing your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
bonnet. Let them know you&#8217;re a woman and
they won&#8217;t fire on <i>you</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>The little mate stood erect. She waved her
pink flag of a sun-bonnet. Distinctly the soldiers
saw the pink frock of Anna Kull; they saw her
long hair as the sea breeze lifted it when she
shook her pink banner.</p>
<p>A second, two, three went by as the girl stood
there, and then a flash was seen on the bank, a
musket-ball ran through the bonnet of the little
mate, and the waves of air rattled along the
shore.</p>
<p>The bonnet was in the sea; Anna had dropped
to her seat and caught the helm in her left hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cowards!&#8221; cried Valentine, for want of a
stronger word, and then he fell to working the
boat on its way. The tide helped them now; it
swung the boat over toward the Jersey shore.</p>
<p>The firing from Staten Island called out the
inhabitants on the Jersey coast. They watched
the approaching boat with interest. Everything
depended now on the cow&#8217;s lying still, on the
boy&#8217;s strength, on the meeting of the tides. If he
could reach there before the tide came up all
would be well; otherwise it would sweep him
off again toward the island.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you row?&#8221; asked Valentine, at length.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bub, I can&#8217;t,&#8221; said Anna, her voice shaking
out the words. It was the first time she had
spoken since she sat down.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you hurt?&#8221; he questioned.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I tremble so,&#8221; she answered, and turned her
face away.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon we&#8217;d better help that boy in,&#8221; said a
Jersey fisherman as he watched, and he put off
in a small boat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t come near! Keep off! keep off!&#8221;
called Valentine, as he saw him approach. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
a cow in here.&#8221;</p>
<p>The fisherman threw him a rope, and that rope
saved them. The dewy smell of the grassy banks
had aroused the cow. She was stirring.</p>
<p>The land was very near now; close at hand.
&#8220;Hurry! hurry!&#8221; urged the lad, as they were
drawing him in. Before the cow had time to
rise, the boat touched land.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better look after that girl,&#8221; said the
fisherman, who had towed the boat. The poor
child was holding, fast wrapped in the remnants
of her pink frock, her bleeding hand. The
musket ball that shot away her bonnet grazed
her wrist.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind me,&#8221; she said, when they were
pitying her. &#8220;The cow is safe.&#8221;</p>
<p>The same evening, while, in Philadelphia,
bonfires were blazing, bells ringing, cannon
booming, because, that day, a new nation was
born; over Staten Island Sound, by the light of
the moon, strong-armed men were ferrying home
the girl and the boy, who that day <i>had</i> fought a
good fight and gained the victory.</p>
<p>At home, in the Kull cottage, the mother
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
waited long for the coming of the children. She
said; &#8220;Poor young things! <i>Mine own children</i>&mdash;they
<i>shall</i> have a nice supper.&#8221; She made it
ready and they were not come.</p>
<p>Farmer Rycker&#8217;s wife and daughter came over
to tell and hear the news, and yet they were not
come.</p>
<p>Sundown. No children. The Kull father came
up from his fishing and heard the story.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Red Coats have taken them,&#8221; he said, and
down came the musket from against the wall, and
out the father marched and made straightway for
the headquarters of General Howe, over at the
present &#8220;Quarantine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the mother, left alone in the soft summer
gloaming, fell on her knees and told her story in
her own plain speech to her good Father in
Heaven.</p>
<p>It was a long story. She had much to say to
Heaven that night. The mothers and wives of
1776 in our land spake often unto God. This
mother listened and prayed, and prayed and
listened.</p>
<p>The fishermen had left Valentine and Anna on
the shore and gone home. Tired, but happy, the
brother and sister went up, over sand and field
and slope, and so came at length within sight
of the trees that towered near home.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whistle now!&#8221; whispered Anna, afraid yet to
speak aloud. &#8220;Mother will hear and answer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Valentine whistled.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span></div>
<p>Up jumped the mother Kull. She ran to the
door and tried to answer. There was no whistle
in her lips. Joy choked it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother, are you <i>there</i>?&#8221; cried the children.</p>
<p>&#8220;No! I&#8217;m <i>here</i>,&#8221; was the answer, and she had
them safe in her arms.</p>

<h2>PATTY RUTTER: THE QUAKER DOLL WHO SLEPT IN INDEPENDENCE HALL.</h2>
</div>
<p>Patty Rutter had fallen asleep with
her bonnet on, and had been lying
there, fast asleep, nobody knew just
how long; for, somehow&mdash;it happened
so&mdash;there was nobody in particular to awaken
her; that is to say, no one had seemed to care
though she slept on all day and all night, without
ever waking up at all.</p>
<p>But then, there never had been another life
quite like Patty Rutter&#8217;s life. In the first place,
it had a curious reason for beginning at all; and
nearly everything about it had been as unlike
your life and mine as possible.</p>
<p>In her very baby days, before she walked or
talked, she had been sent away to live with
strangers, and no real, warm kiss of true love
had ever fallen on her little lips.</p>
<p>It all came about in this way: Mrs. Sarah
Rutter, a lady living in Philadelphia&mdash;exactly
what relation she bore to Patty it is a little difficult
to determine&mdash;decided to send the little one
to live with a certain Mrs. Adams, at Quincy, in
Massachusetts, and she particularly desired that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
the child should go dressed in a style fitting an
inhabitant of the proud city of Philadelphia.</p>
<p>Now, at that time Philadelphia was very much
elated because of several things that had happened
to her; but the biggest pride of all was,
that once upon a time the Continental Congress
had met there, and&mdash;and most wonderful thing&mdash;had
made a Nation!</p>
<p>Well, to be sure, that <i>was</i> something to be
proud of; though Patty didn&#8217;t understand, a bit
more than you do, what it meant. However, the
glory of it all was talked about so much that she
couldn&#8217;t help knowing that, when this nation,
with its fifty-six Fathers, and thirteen Mothers,
was born one day in July, 1776, at Philadelphia,
all the city rang with a sweet jangle, and called
to all the people, through the tongue of its
Liberty bell, to come up and greet the newcomer
with a great shout of welcome.</p>
<p>But that had been long ago, before Mrs. Sarah
Rutter was grown up, or Patty Rutter began
to be dressed for her trip to Quincy.</p>
<p>As I wrote, Mrs. Rutter wished that Patty
should go attired in a manner to do honor to the
city of Philadelphia; therefore she was not permitted
to depart in her baby clothes, but her
little figure was arrayed in a long, prim gown of
soft drab silk, while a kerchief of purest mull was
crossed upon her breast; and, depending from
her waist, like the fashion of to-day, were pincushion
and watch. Upon her youthful head
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
was a bonnet, crowned and trimmed in true
Quaker fashion; and her infantile feet were
securely tied within shapely slippers of kid.
Thus equipped, Miss Patty was sent forth upon
her journey.</p>
<p>Ah! that journey began a long time ago&mdash;fifty-eight,
yes, fifty-nine years have gone by, and
Patty Rutter is quite an aged little lady now, as
she lies asleep, with her bonnet on.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is time,&#8221; says somebody, &#8220;to close.&#8221;</p>
<p>No one seems to take notice that Patty Rutter
does not get up and depart with the rest of the
visitors, that she only stirs her eyelids and turns
her head on the silken &#8220;quilt&#8221; where she is
lying.</p>
<p>The little woman who keeps house in the Hall
locks it up and goes away, and there is little
Patty Rutter shut in for the night. As the key
turns in the old-time lock, the Lady Rutter winks
hard and sits up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve been patient, anyhow, and Mrs.
Samuel Adams herself couldn&#8217;t wish me to do
more,&#8221; she said, with a comforting yawn and a
delightful stretch, and then she began to stare in
blank bewilderment.</p>
<p>&#8220;I <i>should</i> like to know what this all means,&#8221; she
whispered, &#8220;and <i>where</i> I am. I&#8217;ve heard enough
to-day to turn my head. How very queer folks
are, and they talk such jargon now-a-days. Centennial
and Corliss Engine; Woman&#8217;s Pavilion
and Memorial Hall; Main Building and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
Trois Freres; Hydraulic Annex, railroads and
what-nots.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>I</i> never heard of such things. I don&#8217;t think
it is proper to speak of them, or the Adamses
would have told me. No more intelligent folks in
the land than the Adamses, and I guess <i>they</i>
know what belongs to good society and polite
conversation. I declare I blushed so in my sleep
that I was quite ashamed. I&#8217;ll get up and look
about now. I&#8217;m sure this isn&#8217;t any one of the
houses where we visit, or folks wouldn&#8217;t talk so.&#8221;</p>
<p>Patty Rutter straightened her bonnet on her
head, smoothed down her robe of silken drab,
adjusted her kerchief, looked at her watch to
learn how long she had been sleeping, and found,
to her surprise, that it had run down. Right
over her head hung two watches.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, how thoughtful folks are in this house,&#8221;
she exclaimed in a timid voice, reaching up and
taking one of the two time-pieces in her hand.
&#8220;Why, here&#8217;s a name; let me see.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reading slowly, she announced that the watch
belonged to &#8220;Wil-liam Wil-liams&mdash;worn when he
signed the Declaration of Independence.&#8221; &#8220;Ah!&#8221;
she cried, with pathetic tone, &#8220;this watch is run
down <i>too</i>, at four minutes after five. I remember!
<i>This</i> William Williams was one of the fifty-six
Fathers. I guess I must be in Lebanon&mdash;he lived
there and his folks would have his watch of
course. Here&#8217;s another,&#8221; taking down a watch
and reading, &#8220;Colonel John Trumbull. <i>Run
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
down, too!</i> and at twenty-three minutes after six.
<i>He</i> was the son of Brother Jonathan, Governor
of one of the Mothers, when the Nation was born.
Yes, yes, I must be in Lebanon. Well, it&#8217;s a comfort,
at least, to know that I&#8217;m in company the
Adamses would approve of, though <i>how</i> I came
here is a mystery.&#8221;</p>
<p>She hung the watches in place, stepped out of
the glass room, in which she had slept, into a hall,
and with a slight exclamation of delicious approval,
stopped short before a number of chairs,
and clasped her little fingers tightly together.</p>
<p>You must remember that Patty Rutter was a
Friend, a Quaker, perhaps a descendant of William
Penn, but then, in her baby days, having
been transplanted to the rugged soil and outspoken
ways of Massachusetts, she could not
keep silence altogether, in view of that which
greeted her vision.</p>
<p>She was in the very midst of old friends.
Chairs in which she had sat in her young days
stood about the grand hall. On the walls hung
portraits of the ancestor kings of the nation born
at Philadelphia in 1776.</p>
<p>In royal robes and with careless grace, lounged
King George III., the nation&#8217;s grandfather, angry
no longer at his thirteen daughters who strayed
from home with the Sons of Liberty.</p>
<p>Her feet made haste and her eyes opened
wider, as her swift hands seized relic after relic.
She sat in chairs that Washington had rested <ins title='Added ;'>in;</ins>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
she caught up camp-kettles used on every field
where warriors of the Revolution had tarried;
she patted softly La Fayette&#8217;s camp bedstead;
and wondered at the taste that had put into the
hall two old, time-worn, battered doors, but soon
found out that they had gone through all the
storm of balls that fell upon the Chew House
during the battle of Germantown.</p>
<p>She read the wonderful prayer that once was
prayed in Carpenter&#8217;s Hall, and about which
every member of Congress wrote home to his
wife.</p>
<p>On a small &#8220;stand,&#8221; encased in glass, she came
upon a portrait of Washington, painted during
the time he waited for powder at Cambridge.
Patty Rutter had seen it often, with its halo of
the General&#8217;s own hair about it. She turned
from it, and beheld (why, yes, surely she <i>had</i> seen
<i>that</i>, but not here; it was, why long ago, in her
baby days in Philadelphia, that Mrs. Rutter had
taken her up into a tower to see <ins title='Guessing at end of parenthesis'>it)</ins>, a bell&mdash;Liberty
Bell, that rang above the heads of the
Fathers when the Nation was born.</p>
<p>Poor little Patty began to cry. Where could
she be? She reached out her hand, and climbed
the huge beams that encased the bell, and tried
to touch the tongue. She wanted to hear it ring
again, but could not reach it.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s curious, curious,&#8221; she sobbed, wiping her
eyes and turning them with a thrill of delight
upon a beloved name that greeted her vision. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
was growing dark, and she <i>might</i> be wrong. But
no, it was the dear name of Adams; and she saw,
in a basket, a little pile of baby raiment. There
were dainty caps and tiny shirts of cambric,
whose linen was like a gossamer web, and whose
delicate lines of hem-stitch were scarcely discernible;
there were small dresses, yellow with
the sun color that time had poured over them,
and they hung with pathetic crease and tender
fold over the sides of the basket.</p>
<p>The little woman paused and peered to read
these words, &#8220;Baby-clothes, made by Mrs. John
Adams for her son, John Quincy Adams.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Little John Quincy!&#8221; she cried, &#8220;A baby so
long ago!&#8221; She took the little caps in her hands,
she pulled out the crumpled lace that edged
them. She said, through the swift-falling tears:</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I remember when he was brought home
<i>dead</i>, and how, in the Independence Hall of the
State House at Philadelphia, he lay in state, that
the inhabitants who knew his deeds, and those of
his father, John, and his uncle, Samuel, might
see his face. I love the Adamses every one,&#8221; and
she softly pressed the baby-caps that had been
wrought by a mother, ere the country began, to
her small Quaker lips, with real New England
fervor for its very own. Tenderly she laid them
down, to see, while the light was fading, a huge
picture on the wall. She studied it long, trying
to discern the faces, with their savage beauty;
the sturdy right-doing men who stood before
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
them; and then her eyes began to glisten, and
gather light from the picture; her lips parted,
her breath quickened; for Patty Rutter had gone
beyond her life associations in Massachusetts,
back to the times in which her Quaker ancestors
had make treaty with the native Indians.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is!&#8221; she cried with a shout; &#8220;It is Penn&#8217;s
treaty!&#8221; Patty gazed at it until she could see no
longer. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad it is the last thing my eyes
will remember,&#8221; she said sorrowfully, when in
the gloom she turned away, went down the hall,
and entered her glass chamber.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind my watch,&#8221; she said softly.
&#8220;When I waken it will be daylight, and I need
not wind it. It will be so sweet to lie here
through the night in such grand and goodly company.
I only wish Mrs. Samuel Adams could
come and kiss me good night.&#8221;</p>
<p>With these words, Patty Rutter laid herself to
rest upon the silken quilt from Gardiner&#8217;s Island;
and if you look within the Relic Room, opposite
to Independence Hall, in the old State House at
Philadelphia, in this Centennial summer, you will
find her there, still taking her long nap, <i>fully
indorsed by Miss Adams</i>, and in Independence
Hall, across the passage way, you will see the
portraits of more than fifty of the Fathers of the
nation, but the Mothers abide at home.</p>

<h2>BECCA BLACKSTONE&#8217;S TURKEYS AT VALLEY FORGE.</h2>
</div>
<p>Turkeys, little girl and apple-tree lived
in Pennsylvania, a hundred years ago.
The turkeys&mdash;eleven of them&mdash;went
to bed in the apple-tree, one night in
December.</p>
<p>After it was dark, the little girl stood under the
tree and peered up through the boughs and
began to count. She numbered them from one
up to eleven. Addressing the turkeys, she said:
&#8220;You&#8217;re all up there, I see, and if you only knew
enough; if you weren&#8217;t the dear, old, wise, stupid
things that you are, I&#8217;ll tell you what you would
do. After I&#8217;m gone in the house, and the door is
shut, and nobody here to see, you&#8217;d get right
down, and you&#8217;d fly off in a hurry to the deepest
part of the wood to spent your Thanksgiving,
you would. The cold of the woods isn&#8217;t half as
bad for you as the fire of the oven will be.&#8221;</p>
<p>Becca finished her speech; the turkeys rustled
in their feathers and doubtless wondered what it
all meant, while she stood thinking. One poor
fellow lost his balance and came fluttering down
to the ground, just as she had decided what to do.
As soon as he was safely reset on his perch,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
Becca made a second little speech to her audience,
in which she declared that &#8220;they, the dear turkeys,
were her own; that she had a right to do
with them just as she pleased, and that it was her
good pleasure that not one single one of the
eleven should make a part of anybody&#8217;s Thanksgiving
dinner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Heigh-ho,&#8221; whistles Jack, Becca&#8217;s ten-year-old
brother: &#8220;that you, Bec? High time you were
in the house.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;S&#8217;pose I frightened you,&#8221; said Becca. &#8220;Where
have you been gone all the afternoon, I&#8217;d like to
know? stealin&#8217; home too, across lots.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell, if you won&#8217;t let on a mite.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do I ever, Jack?&#8221; reproachfully.</p>
<p>He did not deign to answer, but in confidential
whispers breathed it into her ears that &#8220;he had
been down to the Forge. Down to the Valley
Forge, where General Washington was going to
fetch down lots and lots of soldiers, and build log
huts, and stay all Winter.&#8221; He ended his breathless
narration with an allusion that made Becca
jump as though she had seen a snake. He said:
&#8220;It will be bad for your turkeys.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Jack? General Washington won&#8217;t steal
them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Soldiers eat turkey whenever they can get it;
and, Bec, this apple-tree isn&#8217;t above three miles
from the Forge. You&#8217;d better have &#8217;em all killed
for Thanksgiving. Come, I&#8217;m hungry as a bear.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span></div>
<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said Becca, grasping his jacket sleeve as
they went, &#8220;I&#8217;ve just promised &#8217;em that they shall
not be touched.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack&#8217;s laugh set every turkey into motion, until
the tree was all in a flutter of excitement. He
laughed again and again, before he could say
&#8220;What a little goose you are! Just as if turkeys
understood a word you said.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I understood if they didn&#8217;t, and I should
be telling my own self a lie. No, not a turkey
shall die. They shall all have a real good Thanksgiving
once in their lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two days later, on the 18th of December,
Thanksgiving Day came, the turkeys were yet
alive, and Becca Blackstone was happy.</p>
<p>The next day General Washington&#8217;s eleven
thousand men marched into Valley Forge, and
went out upon the cold, bleak hillsides, carrying
with them almost three thousand poor fellows,
too ill to march, too ill to build log huts, ill
enough to lie down and die. Such a busy time
as there was for days and days. Farmer Blackstone
felt a little toryish in his thoughts, but the
chance to sell logs and split slabs so near home as
Valley Forge was not likely to happen again, and
he worked away with strong good will to furnish
building material. Jack went every day to the
encampment, and grew quite learned in the ways
of warlike men.</p>
<p>Becca staid at home with her mother, but
secretly wished to see what the great army
looked like.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span></div>
<p>At last the final load of chestnut and walnut
and oaken logs went up to the hills from Mr.
Blackstone&#8217;s farm, and a great white snow fell
down over all Pennsylvania, covering the mountains
and hills, the soldiers&#8217; log huts, and the turkeys
in the apple-tree. January came and went,
and every day affairs at the camp grew worse.
Men were dying of hunger and cold and disease.
Stories of the sufferings of the men grew strangely
familiar to the inhabitants. Affairs that Winter
would not have been quite so hard at Valley
Forge if the neighbors for miles around had not
been Tories. Now Becca Blackstone&#8217;s mother
was a New England women, and in secret she bestowed
many a comfort upon one after another of
her countrymen at the encampment. Her husband
was willing to sell logs and slabs and clay
from his pits, but not a farthing or a splinter of
wood had he to bestow on the rebels.</p>
<p>At last, one January day, when Mr. Blackstone
had gone to Philadelphia, permission was given
to Becca to accompany her mother and Jack to
the village. Into the rear of the sleigh a big basket
was packed. Becca was told that she must
not ask any questions nor peep, so she neither
questioned nor looked in, but found out, after all,
for when they were come to the camp, she saw
her mother take out loaves of rye bread and a
jug, into which she knew nothing but milk ever
was put, and carry them into a hut which had the
sign of a hospital over it. Every third cabin was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
a hospital, and each and every one held within it
men that were always hungry and in suffering.</p>
<p>In all her life Becca had never seen so much to
make her feel sorry, as she saw when she followed
her mother to the door of the log-hospital, into
which she was forbidden to enter.</p>
<p>There large-eyed, hungry men lay on the cold
ground, with only poor, wretched blankets to
cover them. She caught a glimpse of a youth&mdash;he
did not seem much older than her own Jack&mdash;with
light, fair hair, such big blue eyes, and the
thinnest, whitest hands, reaching up for the mug
of milk her mother was offering to him.</p>
<p>Then, when Jack came to her, he was wiping
his eyes on his jacket sleeve. He said &#8220;If I was a
soldier, and my country didn&#8217;t care any more for
me than Congress does, I&#8217;d go home and leave
the Red Coats to carry off Congress. It&#8217;s too
bad, and he&#8217;s a jolly good fellow. Wish we
could take him home and get him well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is he, Jack?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O, a soldier-boy from one of the New England
colonies. He&#8217;s got a brother with him&mdash;that&#8217;s
good.&#8221;</p>
<p>The drive home, over the crisp snow, was a
very silent one. More than one tear froze on
Mrs. Blackstone&#8217;s cheek, as she remembered the
misery her eyes had beheld, and her hands could
do so little to lighten.</p>
<p>The next day Mr. Blackstone reached home
from Philadelphia. He had seen the Britons in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
all the glory and pomp of plenty and red regimentals
in a prosperous city. He returned a
confirmed Tory, and wished&mdash;never mind what
he did wish, since his unkind wish never came to
pass&mdash;but this is that which he did, he forbade
Mrs. Blackstone to give anything that belonged
to him to a soldier of General Washington&#8217;s army.</p>
<p>&#8220;What will you do now, mamma, with all the
stockings and mittens you are knitting?&#8221; questioned
Becca.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t ask me, child,&#8221; was the tearful answer
that mother made, for her whole heart was with
her countrymen in their brave struggle.</p>
<p>Three nights after that time Mr. Blackstone
entered his house, saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;I caught a ragged, bare-footed tatterdemalion
hanging around, and I warned him off; told him
he&#8217;d better go home, if he&#8217;d got one anywhere,
and if not to join the army, of his king at Philadelphia.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did he say, pa?&#8221; asked Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;O some tomfoolery or other about the man
having nothing to eat but hay for two days, and
his brother dying over at the Forge. I didn&#8217;t
stop to listen to the fellow, but sent him flying.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack touched his mother&#8217;s toe in passing, and
gave Becca a mysterious nod of the head, as much
as to say:</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s the soldier from our hospital over there,&#8221;
but nobody made answer to Mr. Blackstone.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span></div>
<p>Becca&#8217;s eyes filled with tears as she sat down at
the tea-table, and sturdy Jack staid away until
the last minute, taking all the time he could at
washing his hands, that he might get as many
looks as possible through the window in the hope
that the bare-footed soldier might be lingering
about, but he gained no glimpse of him.</p>
<p>Farmer Blackstone had the rheumatism sometimes,
and that night he had it worse than ever,
so that an hour after tea-time he was quite ready
to go to bed, and his wife was quite ready to
have him go, also to give him the soothing, quieting
remedies he called for.</p>
<p>Becca was to sit up that night until eight-of-the-clock,
if she made no noise to disturb her
father.</p>
<p>While her mother was busied in getting her
father comfortable, she thought, as it was such
bright moonlight, she would go out to give her
turkeys a count, it having been two or three
nights since she had counted them.</p>
<p>Slipping a shawl of her mother&#8217;s over her head,
she opened softly the kitchen door to steal out.
The lowest possible whistle from Jack accosted
her at the house corner. That lad intercepted
her course, drew her back into the shadow, and
bade her &#8220;Look!&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked across the snow, over the garden
wall, into the orchard, and there, beneath her
apple-tree, stood something between a man and a
scarecrow, and it appeared to be looking up at
the sleeping turkeys. Both arms were uplifted.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span></div>
<p>&#8220;O dear! what shall we do?&#8221; whispered
Becca, all in a shiver of cold and excitement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go and speak to him. Maybe it is our
hospital man,&#8221; said Jack, with a great appearance
of courage.</p>
<p>The two children started, hand in hand, and
approached the soldier so quietly that he did not
hear the sound of their coming.</p>
<p>As they went, Becca squeezed her brother&#8217;s
fingers and pointing to the snow over which they
walked, whispered the word &#8220;Blood!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;From his feet,&#8221; responded Jack, shutting his
teeth tightly together.</p>
<p>Yes, there it lay in bright drops on the glistening
snow, showing where the feet of the patriot
had trod. The children stood still when they were
come near to the tree. At the instant their mother
appeared in the kitchen doorway and called
&#8220;Jack!&#8221;</p>
<p>The ragged soldier of the United American
States lost his courage at the instant and began
to retire in confusion; but Becca summoned him
to &#8220;Wait a minute!&#8221; He waited.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you want one of my turkeys?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was going to <i>steal</i> one, to save my brother&#8217;s
life,&#8221; he answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is he only a boy, and has he light hair and
blue eyes, and does he lie on the wet ground?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Joseph,&#8221; he groaned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then take a good, big, fat turkey&mdash;that one
there, if you can get him,&#8221; said Becca. &#8220;They are
all mine.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span></div>
<p>The turkey was quietly secured.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now take one for yourself,&#8221; said Becca.</p>
<p>Number two came down from the perch.</p>
<p>&#8220;How many men are there in your hospital?&#8221;
asked Jack, who had responded to his mother&#8217;s
summons, and was holding a pair of warm stockings
in his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Twelve.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Give him another, Bec&mdash;there&#8217;s a good girl;
three turkeys ain&#8217;t a bone too many for twelve
hungry men,&#8221; prompted Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take three!&#8221; said Becca. &#8220;My pa never
counts my turkeys.&#8221;</p>
<p>The third turkey joined his fellows.</p>
<p>&#8220;Better put these stockings on before you start,
or father will track you to the camp,&#8221; said Jack.
&#8220;And pa told ma never to give you anything of
his any more.&#8221;</p>
<p>Never was weighty burden more cheerfully
borne than the bag Jack helped to hoist over the
soldier&#8217;s shoulder as soon as the stockings had
been drawn over the bleeding feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I&#8217;m going. Thank you, and good night.
If you, little girl, would give me a kiss, I&#8217;d take
it&mdash;as from my little Bessy in Connecticut.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s for Bessy in Connecticut,&#8221; said the
little girl, giving him one kiss, &#8220;and now I&#8217;ll give
you one for Becca in Pennsylvania. Hurry home
and roast the turkeys quick.&#8221;</p>
<p>They watched him go over the hill.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Jack,&#8221; said Becca, &#8220;if I&#8217;d told a lie to the turkeys
where would they have been to-night, and
Joseph? There are eight more. I wish I&#8217;d told
him to come again. Pa&#8217;s rheumatism came just
right to-night, didn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon next year you won&#8217;t have all the
turkeys to give away to the soldiers,&#8221; said Jack,
adding quite loftily, &#8220;I shall go to raising turkeys
in the Spring myself, and when Winter comes we
shall see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Jacky,&#8221; said Becca, half-crying, &#8220;there
are eight left, and you take half.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I won&#8217;t,&#8221; rejoined Jack. &#8220;I&#8217;d just like to
walk over to Valley Forge and see the soldiers
enjoy turkey. Won&#8217;t they have a feast! I
shouldn&#8217;t wonder if they&#8217;d eat one raw.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O, Jack!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Soldiers do eat dreadful things sometimes,&#8221;
he assured her with a lofty air. And then they
went into the house, and the door was shut.</p>
<p>The next year there was not a soldier left above
the sod at Valley Forge.</p>
<p>Now the soldiers are gone, the camp is not, the
little girl has passed away, the apple-tree is dead,
and only the hills at Valley Forge are left to tell
the story, bitter with suffering, eloquent with
praise, of the men who had a hundred years ago
toiled for Freedom there, and are gone home to
God.</p>

<h2>HOW TWO LITTLE STOCKINGS SAVED FORT SAFETY.</h2>
</div>
<p>&#8220;A story, children; so soon after
Christmas, too! Let me think, what
shall it be?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O yes, mamma,&#8221; uttered three
children in chorus.</p>
<p>Mrs. Livingston sat looking into the fire that
flamed on the broad hearth so long, that Carl
said, by way of reminder that time was passing:
&#8220;An uncommon story.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then up spoke Bessie: &#8220;Mamma, something,
please, out of the real old time before much of
anybody &#8217;round here was born.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As long off as the Indians,&#8221; assisted young
Dot.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah yes; that will do, children. I will tell
you a story that happened in this very house
almost a hundred years ago. It was told to me
by my grandmother when she was very old.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a grand old lady, Mrs. Livingston,
at the head of this house then. She loved her
country very much indeed, and was willing to do
anything she could to help it, in the time of great
trouble, during the war for independence. My
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
grandmother was a little girl, not so old as you,
Bessie. Her name was Lorinda Grey, and her
home was in Boston. The year before, when
British soldiers kept close watch to see that nothing
to eat, or wear, or burn, was carried into Boston,
Mr. Grey contrived to get his family out of
the city, and Lorinda, with her brother Otis, was
sent here. Afterward, when Boston was free
again, the two children were left because the
father was too busy to make the long journey
after them.</p>
<p>Altogether, more than a dozen children belonging
in some way to the Livingstons had been sent
to the old house. The family friends and relatives
gave the place the name &#8220;Fort Safety,&#8221;
because it lay far away from the enemy&#8217;s ships,
and quite out of the line where the soldiers of
either army marched or camped.</p>
<p>The year had been very full of sorrow and care
and trouble and hard work; but when the time
for Christmas drew near, this grand old Mrs. Livingston
said it should be the happiest Christmas
that the old house had ever known. She would
make the children happy once, whatever might
come afterward, and so she set about it quite
early in the fall. One day the children (there
were more than a dozen of them in the house at
the time) found out that the great room at the
end of the hall was locked. They asked Mrs.
Livingston many times when it meant, and at last
she told them that one night after they were in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
bed and asleep, Santa Claus appeared at her door
and asked if he might occupy that room until the
night before Christmas. She told him he might,
and he had locked the door himself, and said &#8220;if
any child so much as looked through a crack in
the door that child would find nothing but chestnut
burs in his stocking.&#8221; Well, the children
knew that Santa Claus meant what he said,
always, so they used to run past the door every
day as fast as they could go and keep their eyes
the other way, lest something should be seen that
ought not to. Before the day came every wide
chimney in the house was swept bright and clean
for Santa Claus.</p>
<p>Aunt Elise, a sweet young lady, lived here
then. She was old Mrs. Livingston&#8217;s daughter,
and she told the children that she had seen Santa
Claus with her own eyes when he locked the
door, and he said that every room must be made
as fine as fine could be.</p>
<p>After that Tom and Richard and Will and
Philip worked away as hard as they could. They
gathered bushels and bushels of ivy, and a mile
or two of ground-pine, and eight or ten pecks of
bitter-sweet, and stored them all in the corn
granary, and waited for the day. Then, when
Aunt Elise set to work to adorn the house, she
had twenty-four willing hands to help, beside her
own two.</p>
<p>When all was made ready, and it was getting
near to night in the afternoon before Christmas,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
Mrs. Livingston sent a messenger for three men
from the farm. When they were come, she
called in three African servants, and she said to
the six men, &#8220;Saddle horses and ride away, each
one of you in a different direction, and go to
every house within five miles of here, and ask:
&#8216;Are any children in this habitation?&#8217; Then
say that you are sent to fetch the children&#8217;s
stockings, that Santa Claus wants them, and take
special care to bring me <i>two</i> stockings from each
child, whose father or brother is away fighting for
his country.&#8221;</p>
<p>So the six men set forth on their queer errand,
after stockings, and they rode up hill and down,
and to the great river&#8217;s bank, and wherever the
message was given at a house door, if a child was
within hearing, off flew a stocking, and sometimes
two, as the case might be about father and
brother.</p>
<p>Now, in a deep little dell, about five miles
away, there was a small, old brown house, and in
it lived Mixie Brownson with her mother and
brother, but this night Mixie was all alone.
When one of the six horsemen rode up to the
door, and without getting down from his horse,
thumped away on it with his riding-whip handle,
Mixie thought, &#8220;Like as not it is an Indian,&#8221; but
she straightway lifted the wooden latch and
opened the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s one child here, I see,&#8221; said the black
man. &#8220;Any more?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m all alone,&#8221; trembled forth poor Mixie.</p>
<p>&#8220;More&#8217;s the pity,&#8221; said the man. &#8220;I want one
of your stockings; two of &#8217;em, if you&#8217;re a soldier&#8217;s
little girl. I&#8217;m taking stockings to Santa Claus.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O take both mine, then, please,&#8221; said Mixie
with delight, and she drew off two warm woolen
stockings and made them into a little bundle, which
he thrust into a bag, and off he rode. Mixie&#8217;s
father was a Royalist, fighting with the Indians
for the British, but then Mrs. Livingston knew
nothing about that.</p>
<p>It was nearly midnight when the stockings
reached Fort Safety. It was in this very room
that Mrs. Livingston and Aunt Elise received
them. Some were sweet and clean, and some
were not; some were new and some were old.
So they looked them over, and made two little
piles, the one to be filled, the other to be washed.</p>
<p>About this time Santa Claus came down from
his locked-up room, with pack after pack, and
began to fill stockings. There were ninety-seven
of them, beside sixteen more that were hung on
a line stretched across the fire-place by the children
before they went to bed, so as to be very
handy for Santa Claus when he should enter by
the chimney.</p>
<p>&#8220;What an awful rich lady my fine old Grandmother
Livingston must have been, to have
goodies enough to fill 113 stockings!&#8221; said Carl,
his red hair fairly glistening with interest and
pride; while Bessie and Dot looked eagerly at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
the fire-place and around the room, to see if any
fragment of a stocking might, by any chance, be
about anywhere.</p>
<p>Well, at last the stockings were full. I cannot
tell you exactly what was in them. I remember
that my grandmother said, that in every stocking
went, first of all, a nice, pretty pair of new ones,
just the size of the old ones; and next, a pair of
mittens to fit hands belonging with feet that
could wear the stockings. I know there were
oranges and some kind of candy, too.</p>
<p>At last the stockings were all hung on a line
extending along two sides of the room, and Mrs.
Livingston and Aunt Elise locked the room, and
being very tired, went to bed. The next morning,
bright and early, there was a great pattering
of bare feet and a flitting of night-gowns down
the staircase, past the evergreen trees in the hall,
and a little host of twelve children stood at that
door, trying to get in; but it was all of no use,
and they had to march back to bed again.</p>
<p>As for Otis Grey, he was a real Boston boy,
full of the spirit of a Liberty Rebel. He dressed
himself slyly, slipped down on the great stair-rail,
so as to make no noise, opened softly the
hall-door, went outside, climbed up, and looked
into the room. When he peeped, he was so
frightened at the long line of fat stockings that
he made haste down, and never said a word to
anybody, except my grandmother (Lorinda Grey,
his sister); and they two kept the secret.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span></div>
<p>Breakfast time came, and not a child of the
dozen had heard a word from Santa Claus that
morning.</p>
<p>Mrs. Livingston said a very long grace, and
after that she said to the children: &#8220;I have disappointed
you this morning, but you will all have
your stockings as soon as a little company I have
invited to spend the day with you, is come.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bless me!&#8221; whispered Otis Grey to his sister,
&#8220;are all them stockings a-coming?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Otis,&#8221; said Mrs. Livingston, &#8220;you may leave
the table.&#8221;</p>
<p>Otis obeyed silently, and lost his Christmas
breakfast for the time. Mrs. Livingston had
strict laws in her house, and punishment always
followed disobedience.</p>
<p>The morning was long to the children, but it
was a busy time in the winter kitchen, and even
the summer kitchen was alive with cookery; and
at just mid-day Philip cried out &#8220;Company&#8217;s
come, grandma!&#8221;</p>
<p>A dozen or more of the stocking-owners were
at the door. In they trooped, bright and laughing
and happy. Before they were fairly inside,
more came, and more, and still more, until full
sixty boys and girls were gathered up and down
the great hall and parlors. Mixie Brownson
came on the last sled-load. Now Mrs. Livingston
did not know, even by name, more than one-half
of the young folks she had undertaken to
make happy that day; but that made no manner
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
of difference, and the children had not the least
idea that Santa Claus had their stockings all
hung up in this room, until suddenly the doors
were opened, and there was the great hickory-wood
fire, and the sunlight streaming in, and the
stockings, fat and bulging, hanging in rows.
Some were red, and some were blue, and some
were white, and some were mixed. Grand old
Mrs. Livingston stood within the room, her
white curls shining and her stiff brocade trailing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come in, children,&#8221; she said, and in they
trooped, silent with awe and wonder at the sight
they saw. The lady arranged them side by side,
in lines, on the two sides of the room where the
stockings were not, and then she said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Santa Claus, come forth!&#8221;</p>
<p>In yonder corner there began a motion in the
branches of the evergreen tree, and such a Santa
Claus as crept forth was never seen before. He
was bulgy with furs from crown to foot, but he
made a low curve over toward Mrs. Livingston,
and then nodded his head about the lines of
children.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good day to you, this Christmas,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wish you Merry Christmas, Santa Claus,&#8221;
said Philip, with a bow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s business,&#8221; said Santa Claus. &#8220;Stockings,
let me see. Whoever owns the stocking
that I take down from the line, will step forward
and take it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Every single one of the children knew his or
her own property, at a glance. Santa Claus had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
a busy time of it handing down stockings, and a
few minutes later he escaped without notice, and
was seen no more that year, in Fort Safety.</p>
<p>After the stockings came dinner, and such a
dinner as it was! Whatever there was not, I
remember that it was told to me that there was
great abundance of English plum-pudding. After
dinner came games and more happiness, and
after the last game, came time to go home. The
sweet clear afternoon suddenly became dark with
clouds, and it began to snow soon after the first
load set off. One or two followed, and by the
time the last one was ready to start, Mrs. Livingston
looked forth and said &#8220;not another child
should leave her roof that night in such a blinding
storm.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eight little hands clapped their new mittens
together in token of joy, but poor little Mixie
Brownson began to cry. She had never in her
life been away from the brown house.</p>
<p>Tea was served, and Mixie was comforted for
a short time. After that came games again, until
all were weary with play; and Otis Grey begged
Mrs. Livingston for a story.</p>
<p>Mixie was tearful still, and she crept shyly to
the lady&#8217;s side and sobbed forth: &#8220;I wish you was
my grandma and would take me in your lap.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Livingston stooped and kissed Mixie&#8217;s
cheek, then lifted her on her knees and began to
tell the children a story. It must have been a
very pretty picture that the old, blowing snowstorm
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
looked in upon that night, in this very
room: twenty or more children seated around
the fire-circle, with stately Mrs. Livingston and
pretty Aunt Elise in their midst.</p>
<p>Whilst all this was going on within, outside a
band of Indians, led by a white man, was approaching
Fort Safety to burn it down.</p>
<p>Step by step, the savages crept nearer and
nearer, until they were standing in the very light
that streamed out from the Christmas windows.</p>
<p>The white man who led them was in the service
of the English, and knew every step of the
way, and just who lived in the great house.</p>
<p>He ordered them to stand back while he
looked in. Creeping closer and closer, he
climbed, as Otis Grey had done, and put his face
to the window-pane. He saw Mrs. Livingston
and Miss Elise, and the great circle of eager, interested
faces, all looking at the story-teller, and
he wiped his eyes in order to get one more good
look, for he could not believe the story they told
to him: that his own poor little Mixie was in
there, sitting in proud Mrs. Livingston&#8217;s lap,
looking happier than he had ever seen her. He
stayed so long, peering in, that the savages grew
impatient. One or two of their chief men crept
up and put their swarthy faces beside his own.</p>
<p>It so happened that at that moment Aunt Elise
glanced toward the window. She did not scream,
she uttered no word; but she fell from her chair
to the floor.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

&#8220;His own poor little Mixie was there, sitting in proud Mrs. Livingston&#8217;s lap.&#8221;<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span></div>
<p>Mixie&#8217;s father, for it was he who led the savages,
saw what was happening within, and
ordered the Indians to march away and leave the
big house unhurt. They grunted and grumbled,
and refused to go until they had been told that the
little girl on the lady&#8217;s knee was his little girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;He not going to burn his own papoose,&#8221; explained
the Indian chief to his red men; and
then the evil band went groping away through
the storm.</p>
<p>The story to the children was not finished that
night, for on the floor lay pretty Aunt Elise, as
white as white could be; and it was a long time
before she was able to speak. As soon as she
could sit up, she wished to get out into the open
air.</p>
<p>Mrs. Livingston went with her, and when she
was told what had been seen at the window, they
together examined the freshly fallen snow and
found traces of moccasined feet.</p>
<p>With fear and trembling, the two ladies entered
the house. Not a word of what had been
seen was spoken to servant or child. Aunt Elise
from an upper window kept watch during the
time that Mrs. Livingston returned thanks to
God for the happy day the children had passed,
and asked His love and protecting care during
the silent hours of sleep.</p>
<p>Then the sleepy, happy throng climbed the
wide staircase to the rooms above, went to bed
and slept until morning.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span></div>
<p>Not a red face approached Fort Safety that
night. The two ladies, letting the Christmas
fires go down, kept watch from the windows
until the day dawned.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad,&#8221; exclaimed Carl, &#8220;that my fine,
old, greatest of grandmothers thought of having
that good time at Christmas.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear me!&#8221; sighed Bessie, &#8220;if she hadn&#8217;t, we
wouldn&#8217;t have this nice home to-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mamma,&#8221; said Dot, &#8220;let&#8217;s have a good stocking-time
next Christmas; just like that one, all
but the Indians.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O, mamma, <i>will you</i>?&#8221; cried Bessie, jumping
with glee.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where <i>would</i> we get the soldiers&#8217; children,
though,&#8221; questioned Carl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lots of &#8217;em in Russia and Turkey, if we only
lived there,&#8221; observed Bessie. &#8220;But there&#8217;s
<i>always</i> plenty of children that <i>want</i> a good time
and never get it, just as much as the soldiers&#8217;
children did. Will you, mamma?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When Christmas comes again, I will try to
make just as many little folks happy as I can,&#8221;
said Mrs. Livingston.</p>
<p>&#8220;And we&#8217;ll begin <i>now</i>,&#8221; said Carl, &#8220;so as to be
all ready. I shall saw all summer, so as to make
lots of pretty brackets and things.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I s&#8217;pose I shall have to dress about five
hundred dolls to go &#8217;round,&#8221; sighed Bessie,
&#8220;there are so many children now-a-days.&#8221;</p>

<h2>A DAY AND A NIGHT IN THE OLD PORTER HOUSE.</h2>
</div>
<p>Monday morning, July 5th, 1779, was
oppressively warm and sultry in the
Naugatuck Valley. Great Hill, that
rises so grandly to the northward of
Union City, and at whose base the red house still
nestles that was built either by Daniel Porter or
his son Thomas before or as early as 1735, was
bathed in the full sunlight, for it was past eight of
the clock. Up the hill had just passed a herd of
cows owned by Mr. Thomas Porter and driven
by his son Ethel, a lad of fourteen, and Ethel&#8217;s
sister Polly, aged twelve years.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s awful hot to-day!&#8221; said Ethel, as he
threw himself on the grass at the hill-top&mdash;the
cows having been duly cared for.</p>

The Old Porter House<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better not lose time lying here,&#8221; said
Polly. &#8220;There&#8217;s altogether too much going on
uptown to-day, and there&#8217;s lots to do before we
go up to celebrate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One thing at a time,&#8221; replied Ethel, &#8220;and this
is my time to rest. I never knew a hill to grow
so much in one night before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well! you can rest, but I&#8217;m going to find out
what that fellow is riding his poor horse so fast
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
for this hot morning&mdash;somebody must be dying!
Just see that line of dust a mile away!&#8221; and Polly
started down Great Hill to meet the rider.</p>
<p>The horseman stayed his horse at Fulling Mill
Brook to give him a drink, and Polly reached the
brook just at the instant the horse buried his nose
in the cool stream.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you live near here?&#8221; questioned the
rider.</p>
<p>&#8220;My father, Mr. Thomas Porter, keeps the inn
yonder,&#8221; said Polly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t stop,&#8221; said the horseman, &#8220;though I&#8217;ve
ridden from New Haven without breakfast, and I
must get up to the Center; but you tell your
father the <i>British</i> are landing at West Haven.
They have more that forty vessels! The new
president was on the tower of the College when
I came by, watching with his spy-glass, and he
shouted down that he could see them, landing.&#8221;</p>
<p>At that instant, Ethel reached the brook.
&#8220;What&#8217;s going on?&#8221; he questioned.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a likely looking boy&mdash;you&#8217;ll do!&#8221; said
the horseman, with a glance at Ethel, cutting off
at the same instant the draught his horse was
enjoying, by a sudden pull at the bridle lines.
&#8220;You go tell the news! Get out the militia!
Don&#8217;t lose a minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What news? What for?&#8221; asked Ethel, but
the rider was flying onward.</p>
<p>&#8220;A pretty time we&#8217;ll have celebrating to-day,&#8221;
said Polly, to herself, dipping the corner of her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
apron into the brook and wiping her heated face
with it, as she hurried to the house. Meanwhile,
her brother was running and shouting after the
man who had ridden off in such haste.</p>
<p>As Polly entered the house the big brick oven
stood wide open, and it was filled to the door
with a roaring fire. On the long table stood
loaves of bread almost ready for the oven. Her
sister Sybil was putting apple pies on the same
table. Sybil was a beautiful girl of twenty years,
much admired and greatly beloved in the region.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is Ethel about so long this morning,
that I have his work to do, I wonder!&#8221; exclaimed
Mr. Thomas Porter, as he lifted himself from the
capacious fire-place in which he had been piling
birch-wood under the crane&mdash;from which hung in
a row three big iron pots.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a pretty hot morning, and the sun is
powerful on the hill, father,&#8221; said Mrs. Mehitable
Porter in reply&mdash;not seeing Polly, who stood panting
and glowing with all the importance of having
great news to tell.</p>
<p>&#8220;Father,&#8221; cried Polly, &#8220;where is Truman and
the men? Send &#8217;em! send &#8217;em everywhere!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter? what&#8217;s the matter, child?&#8221;
exclaimed Mr. Porter, while his wife and Sybil
stood in alarm.</p>
<p>At that instant Ethel sprang in, crying out,
&#8220;The militia! The militia! They want the
militia.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span></div>
<p>&#8220;What for, and <i>who</i> wants the men?&#8221; asked
his father.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. He didn&#8217;t stop to tell. He
said: &#8216;Get out the militia! Don&#8217;t lose a minute!&#8217;
and then rode on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Father, <i>I know</i>,&#8221; said Polly. &#8220;He told <i>me</i>.
The British ships, more than forty of them, are
landing soldiers at New Haven. President Stiles
saw them at daybreak from the college tower
with his spy-glass.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before Polly had ceased to speak, Ethel was off.
Within the next ten minutes six horses had set
forth from the Porter house&mdash;each rider for a
special destination.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give the alarm to the Hopkinses,&#8221; cried
back Polly from her pony, as she disappeared in
the direction of Hopkins Hill.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;ll stir up Deacon Gideon and all the
Hotchkisses from the Captain over and down,&#8221;
said ten-year-old Stephen, as he mounted.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better make sure that Sergeant Calkins
and Roswell hear the news. Tell Captain Terrell
to get out his Ring-bone company, and don&#8217;t
forget Captain John and Abraham Lewis, Lieutenant
Beebe, and all the rest. It isn&#8217;t much use
to go over the river&mdash;not much help <i>we&#8217;d</i> get,
however much the British might, on that side,&#8221;
advised Mr. Porter, as the fourth messenger
departed.</p>
<p>When the last courier had set forth, leaving
only Mr. and Mrs. Porter, Sybil and two servants
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
in the house, Mr. Porter said to his wife: &#8220;I
believe, mother, that I&#8217;ll go up town and see
what I can do for Colonel Baldwin and Phineas.&#8221;
Major Phineas Porter was his brother, who six
months earlier had married Melicent, daughter of
Colonel Baldwin and widow of Isaac Booth Lewis
(the lady whose name has been chosen for the
Waterbury, Connecticut, Chapter of Daughters
of the American Revolution).</p>
<p>After Mr. Porter&#8217;s departure Mrs. Porter said
to Sybil, &#8220;You remember how it was two years
ago at the Danbury alarm, how we were left
without a crumb in the house and fairly went
hungry to bed. I think I&#8217;d better stir up a few
extra loaves of rye bread and make some more
cake. You&#8217;d better call up Phyllis and Nancy
and tell them to let the washing go and help me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Phyllis and Nancy were filled with astonishment
and awe at the command to leave the washing
and bake, for, during their twenty years&#8217; service
in the house, nothing had ever been allowed
to stay the progress of Monday&#8217;s washing.</p>
<p>Before mid-day another messenger came tearing
up the New Haven road and demanded a
fresh horse in order to continue the journey to
arouse help and demand haste. He brought the
half-past nine news from New Haven that fifteen
hundred men were marching from West Haven
Green to the bridge, that women and children
were escaping to the northward and westward
with all the treasure that they could carry, or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
bury on the way, because every horse in the town
had been taken for the defence.</p>
<p>He had not finished his story, when from the
northward the hastily equipped militia came hurrying
down the road. It was reported that messengers
had been posted from Waterbury Centre
to Westbury and to Northbury; to West Farms
and to Farmingbury&mdash;all parts of ancient Waterbury&mdash;and
soon The City, as it was called in
1779, now Union City, would be filled with militiamen.</p>
<p>The messenger from New Haven grew impatient
for the fresh horse he had asked for. While
he waited on the porch, Cato, son of Phyllis,
whose duty it was to make ready his steed, sought
Mrs. Porter in the kitchen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where that New Haven fellow,&#8221; he asked,
&#8220;get Massa&#8217;s horse. He say he come from New
Haven, and he got the horse Ethel went away
on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sure, Cato?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure&#8217;s I know Cato,&#8221; said the boy, &#8220;and the
horse he knew me&mdash;be a fool if he didn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Porter immediately summoned the rider
to her presence and learned from him that about
four miles down the road his pony had given out
under haste and heat; that he had met a boy who,
pitying its condition, had offered an exchange of
animals, provided the courier would promise to
leave his pony at the Porter Inn and get a fresh
horse there.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Just like Ethel!&#8221; said Polly. &#8220;He&#8217;ll dally
all day now, while that horse gets rested and fed,
or else he&#8217;ll go on foot. I wonder if I couldn&#8217;t
catch him!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Polly,&#8221; said Mrs. Porter, &#8220;don&#8217;t you leave
this house to-day without my permission.&#8221;</p>
<p>Poor Mrs. Porter! Truman, her eldest son,
had gone. He was sixteen and had been a
&#8220;trained&#8221; soldier for more than six months;
that, the mother expected; but Ethel, only fourteen,
and full of daring and boyish zeal! Stephen
also, the youngest, and the baby, being but ten
years old&mdash;he had not yet returned from &#8220;stirring
up the Hotchkisses.&#8221; Had he followed
Captain Gideon?</p>
<p>&#8220;Ethel is too far ahead,&#8221; sighed Polly. &#8220;I
couldn&#8217;t catch him now, even if mother would let
me; but here comes Uncle Phineas in his regimentals,
and Aunt Melicent and Polly and little
Melicent, and O! what a crowd! I can&#8217;t see for
the dust! It&#8217;s better than the celebration. It&#8217;s
so <i>real</i>, so &#8217;strue as you live and breathe and
everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>Polly ran to the front door. At that day it
opened upon a porch that extended across the
house front. This porch was supported by a line
of white pillars, and a rail along its front had
rings inserted in it to which a horseman could,
after dismounting beneath its shelter, secure his
steed. Long ago, this porch was removed and
the house itself was taken from the roadside on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
the plain below, because of a great freshet, and
removed to its present location. The history of
that porch, of the men and women who dismounted
beneath its shelter, or who, footsore and
weary, mounted its steps, would be the history of
the country for more than a century, for the men
of Waterbury were in every enterprise in which
the colonies were engaged; but this is the record
of a single day in its eventful life, and we must
return to the porch, where Polly is welcoming
Mrs. Melicent Porter with the words: &#8220;Mother
will be so glad you have come, Aunt Melicent,
for Ethel has gone off to New Haven and he&#8217;s
miles ahead of catching, and Stephen hasn&#8217;t got
back yet from &#8217;rousing the Alarm company.
Mother wouldn&#8217;t <i>say</i> a word, but she has got her
mouth fixed and I know she&#8217;s afraid he&#8217;s gone,
too. I don&#8217;t know what father will do when he
finds it out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You go, now,&#8221; said Mrs. Porter, &#8220;and tell
your mother that your father staid to go to the
mill. He will not be here for some time.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Polly went to the kitchen with the message,
Mrs. Melicent alighted from her horse and,
assisting her little daughter Melicent from the
saddle, said: &#8220;You are heavier to-day, Milly,
than you were when I threw you to the bank
from my horse when it was floating down the
river. I couldn&#8217;t do it now.&#8221;</p>
<p>The instant Major Porter had set little Polly
Lewis on the porch Mrs. Porter was beside him,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
begging that he would look for Ethel and care for
the boy if he found him. The promise was given,
and looking well despite the uncommon heat, the
Major, in all the glory of his military equipment,
set forth.</p>
<p>From that moment all was noise and call and
confusion without. Men went by singly, in
groups, in squads, in companies, mounted and on
foot. It is a matter of public record that twelve
militia companies, with their respective captains,
went from Waterbury alone to assist New Haven
in the day of its peril. It is no marvel that they
set off with speed, for the horrors of the Danbury
burning was yet fresh in memory.</p>
<p>In the long kitchen, as the heated hours went
by, the brick oven was fired again and again until
the very stones of the chimney expanded with
glowing heat, and the last swallow forsook its
ancient nest in despair. The sun was in the west
when Mr. Porter, with a bag of wheat on one side
of the saddle and a bag of rye on the other,
appeared at the kitchen entrance and summoned
help to unload, but his accustomed helpers were
gone. Even Cato, the reliable, was missing.
Phyllis and Nancy received the wheat and the
rye.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; said Mr. Porter, &#8220;I had to do the
grinding myself&mdash;couldn&#8217;t find a man to do it, and
I knew it couldn&#8217;t be done here to-day, water&#8217;s
too low. Where are the boys?&#8221; he questioned,
as he entered and looked around. When informed,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
his sole ejaculation was, &#8220;I ought to
have known that boys always have gone and
always will go after soldiers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, mother,&#8221; he added to his wife,
as she stood looking wistfully down the road.</p>
<p>There were tears in her eyes as she said: &#8220;Not
a boy left.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why yes, mother, here comes Stephen and
Stiles Hotchkiss up the road. My! how tired
and hot the boys and the horses do look!&#8221; exclaimed
Polly.</p>
<p>Stephen waited for no reprimand. He forestalled
it by saying: &#8220;Captain Hotchkiss let
Stiles and me go far enough to <i>see</i> the British
troops&mdash;way off, ever so far&mdash;but we saw &#8217;em, we
did, didn&#8217;t we, Stiles?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come! come!&#8221; said Mr. Porter, while the
lad&#8217;s mother stood with her hand on his head.
&#8220;Stephen, tell us all about it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Captain Hotchkiss said he was a boy once,
and if we&#8217;d promise him to go home the minute
he told us to, he&#8217;d take us along. Well! we kept
meeting folks running away from New Haven,
with everything on &#8217;em but their heads. One
woman was lugging a lot of salt pork, &#8216;because
she couldn&#8217;t bear to have the Britishers eat it all
up;&#8217; and another woman was carrying away a
lot of candles hanging by a string, and the sun
had melted the last drop of tallow, leaving the
wicks dangling against the tallow on her dress,
but she didn&#8217;t know it; and mother, would you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
believe it&mdash;Mr. Timothy Atwater told Captain
Hotchkiss that he met a woman whom he knew
hurrying out of town with a cat in her arms.
When he asked her where her children were, she
said, &#8216;Why, at home I suppose.&#8217; &#8216;Well,&#8217; said Mr.
Atwater, &#8216;hadn&#8217;t you better leave the cat and go
back and get them?&#8217; And she said, &#8216;Perhaps
she had,&#8217; and went back for &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What became of the cat?&#8221; asked Mrs. Melicent
Porter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Aunt Melicent, how nice!&#8221; cried
Stephen, running back to the porch and returning
with a cat in his arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve fetched her to you. I <i>knew</i> you loved
cats so! Here she is, black as ink, and she stuck
to the saddle every step of the way like a true
soldier&#8217;s cat. I was afraid she&#8217;d run away when
I took her off the saddle, and I hid her. You
know mother don&#8217;t like cats around under her
feet.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a minute pussy was on the floor, and the last
drop of milk in the house was set before her by
little Polly Lewis. Little Melicent cooed softly
to her, while Stephen and Stiles went on with
their story,&mdash;from which it was learned that the
boys had gone within a mile of Hotchkisstown
(now Westville), where, from a height, they had
a view of the British troops. The lads were
filled with admiration of the marching, &#8220;as
though it was all one motion,&#8221; of the &#8220;mingling
colors of the uniforms worn, as the bright red of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
the English Foot Guards blended with the graver
hues of the dress worn by the German mercenaries,&#8221;
and of &#8220;the waving line of glittering
bayonets.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t see,&#8221; said Stephen, &#8220;but just one
flash of musketry, because Stiles&#8217;s father said we
must start that instant for home, and he told
Stiles to stay here until morning, and we haven&#8217;t
had a mouthful to eat since breakfast, and its been
the hottest day that ever was, and I&#8217;m tired to
death.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the cows are on the hill and nobody here
to fetch them down,&#8221; sighed Mr. Porter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Such a lot of captains waiting to see you,
father!&#8221; announced Polly. &#8220;There&#8217;s Captain
Woodruff and Captain Castle and Captain Richards
and a Fenn captain and a Garnsey captain.
I forget the rest.&#8221; The captains invaded the
kitchen itself, declaring that it being Monday in
the week, every householder had been short of
provisions for the emergency&mdash;that every inn on
the way and many a private house had been
unable to provide enough for so many men, and
what could they have at the Porter Inn?</p>
<p>Polly disappeared. Before her father had considered
the matter she had, assisted by her Aunt
Melicent and Polly Lewis, seized from the pantry
shelves all that they could carry, and going by a
rear way, had hidden on the garret stairs a big
roast of veal, one of lamb, and enough bread and
pies for family requirements, and still the pantry
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
shelves seemed amply filled. &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to
have Ethel come home in the night and find nothing
left for him I know, and the hungry boys fast
asleep and tired out on the kitchen settle will
come to life ravenous. Wonder if I hadn&#8217;t better
be missing just now and go fetch the cows down.
Father would have asthma all night if he tried
it,&#8221; said Polly to her aunt; and up the hill Polly
went accompanied by little Polly&mdash;while Mrs.
Porter stood by and saw the fruits of her hard
day&#8217;s work vanish out of sight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pray leave something for your own household,&#8221;
she ventured to intercede at last. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
forget that we have four guests of our own for
the night;&#8221; but Mr. Porter, rather proud to show
that, however remiss others had been, the Porter
Inn was prepared for emergencies, had already
bidden Nancy and Phyllis fetch forth the last
loaf.</p>
<p>&#8220;Like one for supper,&#8221; ventured Nancy, as her
master carefully examined the empty larder, hoping
to find something more. As the last captain
from Northbury started on the night journey for
New Haven, Mr. Porter faced his wife. &#8220;Now
Thomas Porter,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you can go hungry
to bed, but what can I do for my guests and the
children and the rest of the household?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Porter scratched his head&mdash;a habit when
profoundly in doubt&mdash;and said: &#8220;I must fetch the
cows! It&#8217;s most dark now,&#8221; and set forth, to find
that Polly had them all safely in the cattle yard.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I suppose, father,&#8221; said Polly, &#8220;that we&#8217;ve
got to live on milk to-night. I thought so when
I heard you parleying with the captains. So I
thought I&#8217;d get the cows down.&#8221; As Polly entered
the house, she saw a lady and two girls of about
her own age, to whom her mother was saying:
&#8220;We will give you shelter, gladly, but my husband
has just let the militia you met just below
have the last morsel of cooked food in our house,
and we&#8217;ve nothing left for ourselves but milk for
supper.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; said Polly, stepping to the front;
&#8220;we have plenty! I looked out for you before
father got to the pantry. I made journeys to the
garret stairs, several of them, and Aunt Melicent
and Polly Lewis helped me. It is all right for
the lady to stay.&#8221;</p>
<p>The lady in question was Mrs. Thankful Punderson
and her twin daughters, girls of twelve
years, who had escaped from New Haven just as
the British troops reached Broadway, and the
riot and plunder and killing began. &#8220;I hoped,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;to reach the house of my husband&#8217;s
sister, Mrs. Zachariah Thompson, in Westbury,
but Anna and Thankful are too tired to walk
further to-night, and the horse can carry but two.
It is getting late, and I am so thankful to stay.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Mr. Porter stood on the porch looking down
the road for the next arrival, hoping to learn
some later news and perhaps to hear Ethel&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
cheery call in the distance, Polly said: &#8220;Father,
will you let me be innkeeper to-night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gladly, Polly, with nothing to keep and not a
room to spare,&#8221; was his reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll invite you to supper, and mind, if the
ministers themselves come, they can&#8217;t have a bite
to-night, for I&#8217;m the keeper.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you&#8217;ve made us some hasty pudding
while the milking was going on,&#8221; he said, as
Polly, preceding her father for once, went before,
and opened the door upon a table abundantly
supplied, and laid for twelve.</p>
<p>At the table Mr. Porter told, for the benefit of
Mrs. Melicent Porter and Mrs. Punderson, some
of the events, both pathetic and tragic, that had
occurred in the old house during his boyhood
and youth, and Mrs. Melicent Porter told again
the events of the day in June&mdash;only a year before&mdash;wherein
the battle of Monmouth had been
fought near her New Jersey home, and she had
spent the day in doing what she could to relieve
the sufferings of men so spent with battle and
heat and wounds that they panted to her door
with tongues hanging from their mouths; also of
her perilous journey from New Jersey to Connecticut
on horseback, accompanied by Lieutenant-Colonel
Baldwin, her father&mdash;during which
journey it was, that she had thrown her daughter
Melicent in safety from her horse to the bank of
the river they were fording, while the animal,
having lost its footing, was going down the current.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span></div>
<p>While these things had been in the telling,
Polly had slipped from the table unnoticed, and
had lighted every lamp that could brighten the
house front and serve to guide to its porch. The
last lamp was just alight when Polly&#8217;s guests
began to arrive. She half expected soldiers, and
refugees came. It seemed to her that every
family in New Haven must be related to every
family in Waterbury&mdash;so many women and children
came in to rest themselves before continuing
the journey and &#8220;to wait until the moon
should rise,&#8221; for the evening was very dark, and
oh! the stories that each fresh arrival brought!
They filled the group that came in to listen with
fear and agony. New Haven was very near to
Waterbury in that day. The inhabitants there
were closely connected with the inhabitants here,
and their peril and distress was a common woe.
Little Stiles Hotchkiss cried himself to sleep that
night, fearing that one of the three Hotchkisses,
reported killed, might be his father.</p>
<p>Polly acted well her part. To the children she
gave fresh milk; to their elders she explained that
the militia had taken their supplies, while she
made place to receive two or three invalids who
could go no further, by giving up her own room.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll let me lie on the floor in your room,
Aunt Melicent, I know,&#8221; she said, &#8220;for the poor
lady is so old and so feeble; I&#8217;m most sure she is
a hundred. She came in a chaise and wanted to
get up to Parson Leavenworth&#8217;s, but she just
can&#8217;t. She can&#8217;t hold up her head.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span></div>
<p>It was near midnight when the refugees set
forth for the Center, Mr. Porter himself acting as
guide. After that time, the sleepy boys and the
entire household having taken themselves to bed,
the old house was left to the night, with its silence
and its chill dampness that always comes up from
the river, that goes on &#8220;singing to us the same
bonny nonsense,&#8221; despite our cheer or our
sorrow. Again, and yet again through the night,
doors opened and two mothers stepped out in the
moonlight to listen, hoping&mdash;hoping to hear sound
of the coming of the boys, but only the lone cry
of the whippoorwill was borne on the air.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Pears like,&#8221; said Phyllis to Mrs. Porter in the
morning, &#8220;the whippoorwills had lots to say last
night; talked all night so&#8217;s you couldn&#8217;t hear
nothing &#8217;tall.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Phyllis,&#8221; said Mrs. Porter, &#8220;there was nothing
else to hear, but we shall know soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Polly came down, bringing her checked linen
apron full of eggs for breakfast. &#8220;I thought,
mother,&#8221; she said, &#8220;that you&#8217;d leave yourself
without an egg yesterday, so I looked out. Isn&#8217;t
it handy to have them in the house? Haven&#8217;t
heard a single cackle this morning yet, but yesterday
was a remarkable day everyway. I believe
the hens knew the British were coming.
Did you ever see such eggs? Wonder if my old
lady is awake yet! Guess I&#8217;ll carry up some hot
water for her and find out.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span></div>
<p>Polly poured the water deftly from the big iron
tea-kettle hanging from the crane and hurried
away with it, only to return with such haste that
she tripped on the threshold, broke the pitcher
and sent the water over everything it could reach.
&#8220;Mother,&#8221; she said, recovering herself, &#8220;Parson
Leavenworth will be here to breakfast. He&#8217;s
coming down the road with father. My old lady
will feel honored, won&#8217;t she? I know he&#8217;s come
for her. Phyllis, any more hot water to spare?
It&#8217;s so good to take out wrinkles; she&#8217;ll miss it, I
know.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sun had not climbed over Great Hill when
breakfast was over, and the last guest of the
night had gone. Mrs. Punderson&#8217;s daughter
Anna rode behind the Rev. Mark Leavenworth
on his horse, Thankful with Mrs. Punderson, the
old lady in the chaise, and even Stiles had galloped
away toward the east, and yet not a
traveler on the road had brought tidings from
New Haven. The group on the porch watching
the departure had not dispersed when Polly&#8217;s ears
caught a strain floating up the river valley. She
listened. She ran. She clasped her mother in
her arms. She kissed her. She whispered in
her ear, &#8220;I hear him! He&#8217;s coming! Ethel is;
and Cato is with him!&#8221; she cried out, embracing
Phyllis in her joy. The two mothers&mdash;the one
white, the other black; the one free, the other in
bonds&mdash;went to listen. They stood side by side
on the porch; tears fell from their eyes, tears that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
through all the years science has failed to distinguish,
the one from the other. Ethel&#8217;s cheery
call rang clear and clearer. Cato&#8217;s wild cadence
grew near and nearer, but when the boys rode up
beside the porch, Mrs. Porter was on her knees in
the little bed-room off the parlor, and Phyllis was
in the kitchen. New England mothers, both of
them! Their sorrows they could bear; their joys
they hid from sight.</p>
